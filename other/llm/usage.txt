Sure! Here’s how we can approach the task of simulating data, cleaning it, filtering for crime data by NIA names, joining it with the NIA area, reshaping the crime data into a long format, and then summarizing the statistics by NIA area.
Simulating the data
I’ll simulate a small dataset similar to the structure you've provided. We’ll assume a few records for demonstration purposes. Once simulated, we can clean, filter, and reshape it as per your instructions.
Plan
1.	Simulate NIA Data: This will represent the Neighborhood Improvement Areas (NIA) dataset.
2.	Simulate Crime Data: Crime statistics dataset similar to the one you described.
3.	Data Cleaning:
o	Standardize area names by converting them to lowercase.
o	Filter crime data based on NIA areas.
4.	Joining Data:
o	Join the crime data with the NIA data based on the common AREA_NAME.
5.	Reshape Data:
o	Reshape the crime data into long format.
6.	Summarize Crime Statistics:
o	Summarize the data by NIA area.
I’ll create Python code that can simulate the data and perform these steps. Here's how the simulation and cleaning code will look:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Simulate NIA Data
nia_data = pd.DataFrame({
    '_id': range(1, 6),
    'AREA_NAME': ['Downsview', 'South Eglinton-Davisville', 'Regent Park', 'Scarborough Village', 'North York'],
    'AREA_ID': [2502359, 2502360, 2502361, 2502362, 2502363],
    'DATE_EFFECTIVE': pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=5, freq='Y'),
    'DATE_EXPIRY': ['3000-01-01'] * 5,
    'AREA_DESC': ['Downsview description', 'South Eglinton-Davisville description', 'Regent Park description', 'Scarborough Village description', 'North York description'],
})

# Step 2: Simulate Crime Data (Selected crime columns for simplicity)
crime_data = pd.DataFrame({
    '_id': range(1, 6),
    'AREA_NAME': ['downsview', 'south eglinton-davisville', 'regent park', 'scarborough village', 'north york'],
    'HOOD_ID': [174, 175, 176, 177, 178],
    'ASSAULT_2014': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=5),
    'ASSAULT_2015': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=5),
    'ASSAULT_2016': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=5),
    'ASSAULT_2017': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=5),
    'AUTO_THEFT_2014': np.random.randint(5, 20, size=5),
    'AUTO_THEFT_2015': np.random.randint(5, 20, size=5),
    'AUTO_THEFT_2016': np.random.randint(5, 20, size=5),
    'AUTO_THEFT_2017': np.random.randint(5, 20, size=5),
})

# Step 3: Clean Data
# Standardize AREA_NAME to lowercase
nia_data['AREA_NAME'] = nia_data['AREA_NAME'].str.lower()

# Step 4: Join Data
# Join NIA data with crime data based on AREA_NAME
merged_data = pd.merge(nia_data, crime_data, on='AREA_NAME')

# Step 5: Reshape Crime Data to Long Format
crime_long = pd.melt(merged_data, id_vars=['AREA_NAME', 'AREA_ID'], 
                     value_vars=['ASSAULT_2014', 'ASSAULT_2015', 'ASSAULT_2016', 'ASSAULT_2017',
                                 'AUTO_THEFT_2014', 'AUTO_THEFT_2015', 'AUTO_THEFT_2016', 'AUTO_THEFT_2017'],
                     var_name='Crime_Type_Year', value_name='Crime_Count')

# Step 6: Summarize Crime Statistics by NIA Area
crime_summary = crime_long.groupby('AREA_NAME')['Crime_Count'].sum().reset_index()
crime_summary.rename(columns={'Crime_Count': 'Total_Crime_Count'}, inplace=True)

import ace_tools as tools; tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Crime Data Summary", dataframe=crime_summary)
This code:
•	Simulates both NIA and crime data.
•	Standardizes the area names to lowercase.
•	Joins the two datasets on AREA_NAME.
•	Reshapes the crime data to long format, so we can easily analyze trends by Crime_Type_Year.
•	Summarizes the total crime count by each NIA area.
You can run this process on your actual data, replacing the simulation part with the actual datasets. Let me know if you'd like to modify this or if there's another aspect you'd like to explore!

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Step 1: Simulate NIA Data
nia_data <- data.frame(
  _id = 1:5,
  AREA_NAME = c('Downsview', 'South Eglinton-Davisville', 'Regent Park', 'Scarborough Village', 'North York'),
  AREA_ID = c(2502359, 2502360, 2502361, 2502362, 2502363),
  DATE_EFFECTIVE = as.Date(c('2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05')),

  AREA_DESC = c('Downsview description', 'South Eglinton-Davisville description', 'Regent Park description', 'Scarborough Village description', 'North York description')
)

# Step 2: Simulate Neighbourhood Crime Rates Data
crime_data <- data.frame(
  _id = 1:5,
  AREA_NAME = tolower(c('Downsview', 'South Eglinton-Davisville', 'Regent Park', 'Scarborough Village', 'North York')), # lowercase area names for simulation
  HOOD_ID = c(174, 175, 176, 177, 178),
  ASSAULT_2014 = sample(50:100, 5),
  ASSAULT_2015 = sample(50:100, 5),

  AUTO_THEFT_2016 = sample(5:20, 5),
  AUTO_THEFT_2017 = sample(5:20, 5)
)

# Step 3: Clean Data
# Convert NIA AREA_NAME to lowercase for consistent comparison
nia_data <- nia_data %>%
  mutate(AREA_NAME = tolower(AREA_NAME))

# Step 4: Join the data by AREA_NAME
merged_data <- left_join(nia_data, crime_data, by = "AREA_NAME")

# Step 5: Reshape Crime Data to Long Format
crime_long <- merged_data %>%

               names_to = "Crime_Type_Year",
               values_to = "Crime_Count")

# Step 6: Summarize Crime Statistics by NIA Area
crime_summary <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(AREA_NAME) %>%
  summarize(Total_Crime_Count = sum(Crime_Count, na.rm = TRUE))

# Display the summarized crime statistics
print(crime_summary)
Explanation:
1.	NIA Data Simulation: The nia_data dataframe represents the NIA dataset with area names and details.
2.	Crime Data Simulation: The crime_data dataframe simulates crime statistics for each area with specific years and crime types.
3.	Data Cleaning: The area names in nia_data are standardized to lowercase for a consistent join.
4.	Data Joining: The crime data and NIA data are merged by AREA_NAME.
5.	Reshaping Data: Crime data is reshaped to a long format using pivot_longer, making it easier to analyze crime trends by year and type.
6.	Summarizing Crime Data: Crime statistics are summarized by AREA_NAME, calculating the total crime count per area.
You can replace the simulated data with your actual dataset and adapt the code to handle the full data range. Let me know if you need further modifications!

You're right! Given that you have 31 Neighborhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) and crime data spanning from 2014 to 2023, simulating only 5 neighborhoods would not be sufficient to reflect the scale of your actual project. I’ll adjust the simulation to include:
•	31 neighborhoods (to match your real NIA data).
•	Crime data from 2014 to 2023 with a variety of crime types.

Changes Made:
1.	31 Neighborhoods: Adjusted the simulation to cover all 31 neighborhoods listed.
2.	Crime Data from 2014 to 2023: Crime data is simulated for each neighborhood from 2014 to 2023, with 9 different crime types.
3.	Variety of Crimes: Added a wider variety of crime types to match the real data more closely.
4.	Expanded Dataset: Crime data is generated for each neighborhood across multiple years for each crime type.
Next Steps:
•	You can replace the simulated data with your actual data files and run the same process.
•	You can also modify the crime_types to include any additional types specific to your dataset.
Let me know if you'd like to tweak this further or need help with additional analyses!

# Step 2: Simulate Neighborhood Crime Rates Data for 31 Neighborhoods from 2014 to 2023

Adjustments:
1.	Excluded Geometry and HOOD_ID: The simulated crime data now excludes these unnecessary columns.
2.	NIA Neighborhood Names Only: The simulation focuses on the AREA_NAME field, which will serve as the joining factor between NIA and crime data.
3.	Crime Data from 2014 to 2023: Each neighborhood has simulated crime counts for each year and crime type.
4.	Long Format Reshaping: The crime data is reshaped into a long format to make analysis easier.
You can now run this R script on your actual data, replacing the simulation part with the real datasets. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

print(crime_summary)
Explanation of Changes:
1.	Directory Creation: The script checks if the data/simulated_data directory exists. If not, it creates it using the dir.create() function.
2.	Saving the Data: The write.csv() function saves both nia_data (Neighborhood Improvement Areas) and crime_wide (crime data) as CSV files in the data/simulated_data directory.
Running this script will generate the simulated data and save it as:
•	simulated_nia_data.csv
•	simulated_crime_data.csv

The error message indicates two different issues:
1.	Differing number of rows: This occurs because the number of area names in the vector is 32, while you're trying to create a data frame with 31 rows.
2.	Unexpected symbol: The second error is likely due to a syntax issue in your script around line 17.
Let's fix both issues:
1.	Differing Rows: The list of neighborhood names should have 31 values, but it currently has 32. I'll correct that by ensuring only 31 names are used.

The error you're seeing indicates a syntax issue with how the data frame is being constructed. The data.frame() function expects the full expression for each column, and _id seems to be causing the issue due to incorrect formatting.

Explanation:
1.	Backticks (_id): In R, variable names starting with _ can sometimes cause issues, so backticks are used to escape such variable names. I've added backticks around _id to prevent this problem.
2.	Syntax Correction: Now the code should run properly without syntax errors.
You can now replace this section in your script and try running it again. Let me know if it resolves the issue!

It seems that the list you provided contains multiple duplicates of the same neighborhood names. Each name appears 10 times for each neighborhood. If you're looking for 31 unique neighborhood names, we should extract just one instance of each name. Here's how you can handle this in R:
Extract Unique Neighborhood Names from the List:
r
Copy code
# Neighborhood names provided
neighborhood_names <- c(
  'beechborough-greenbrook', 'black creek', 'downsview', 'eglinton east', 'elms-old rexdale',
  'flemingdon park', 'glenfield-jane heights', 'golfdale-cedarbrae-woburn', 'humber summit', 'humbermede',
  'ionview', 'keelesdale-eglinton west', 'kennedy park', 'kingsview village-the westway', 'morningside',
  'mount dennis', 'mount olive-silverstone-jamestown', 'oakdale-beverley heights', 'oakridge', 'regent park',
  'rockcliffe-smythe', 'rustic', 'scarborough village', 'south parkdale', 'taylor-massey',
  'thistletown-beaumond heights', 'thorncliffe park', 'victoria village', 'west hill', 'weston', 
  'weston-pelham park', 'woburn north', 'york university heights'
)

# Extract unique neighborhood names
unique_neighborhood_names <- unique(neighborhood_names)

# Check the result
print(unique_neighborhood_names)
Explanation:
1.	neighborhood_names: The list includes all the names you provided.
2.	unique(): The unique() function is used to extract just one instance of each neighborhood name.
3.	Result: You now have 31 unique neighborhood names ready to be used in your simulation.
Once you have the unique neighborhood names, you can replace the AREA_NAME vector in your simulation code with these unique names:
r
Copy code
# Replace this part in the previous code with the unique neighborhood names
nia_data <- data.frame(
  `_id` = 1:31,  # Correct use of _id with backticks
  AREA_NAME = tolower(unique_neighborhood_names),  # Use unique neighborhood names here
  # Rest of the code follows...
)
This will prevent duplicates in your simulation and ensure that only 31 unique neighborhood names are used.
Let me know if this works for you or if you need any further adjustments!

Here’s how you can perform the tests you mentioned in R. Assuming you have the data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia.csv file, use the following code:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the dataset
file_path <- "data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia.csv"
nia_crime_data <- read_csv(file_path)

# Test 1: Check if only NIA neighbourhoods are included by AREA_NAME
nia_neighbourhoods <- c('beechborough-greenbrook', 'black creek')  # Add all NIA neighbourhoods as needed
only_nia_neighbourhoods <- nia_crime_data %>%
  filter(!(AREA_NAME %in% nia_neighbourhoods))

# If this dataframe is empty, only NIA neighborhoods are included
print("Non-NIA neighborhoods in the data:")
print(only_nia_neighbourhoods)

# Test 2: Check for negative values in crime counts
negative_values <- nia_crime_data %>%
  select(ASSAULT, BIKETHEFT, BREAKENTER, HOMICIDE, ROBBERY, SHOOTING, THEFTFROMMV, THEFTOVER) %>%
  summarise_all(~ sum(. < 0))

print("Number of negative values in crime columns:")
print(negative_values)

# Test 3: Summary statistics for key crime types
summary_statistics <- nia_crime_data %>%
  select(ASSAULT, BIKETHEFT, BREAKENTER, HOMICIDE, ROBBERY, SHOOTING, THEFTFROMMV, THEFTOVER) %>%
  summary()

print("Summary statistics for key crime types:")
print(summary_statistics)

# Test 4: Check for missing values
missing_values <- sapply(nia_crime_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)
Explanation of the tests:
Test for NIA Neighbourhoods: This checks if there are any areas in the dataset that do not belong to the NIA neighborhood list.
Test for Negative Values: This checks for any negative values in the crime count columns.
Summary Statistics: Provides summary statistics (min, max, median, etc.) for each of the key crime types.
Missing Values: This checks for any missing values in the dataset.
Run this code in your R environment to check the dataset. Let me know if you need further help!

Here is the revised R code using only the tidyverse package, which should work on your Mac without additional libraries:

r
Copy code
# Load required library
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
file_path <- "data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia.csv"
nia_crime_data <- read_csv(file_path)

# Test 1: Check if only NIA neighbourhoods are included by AREA_NAME
nia_neighbourhoods <- c('beechborough-greenbrook', 'black creek')  # Add all NIA neighbourhoods as needed
only_nia_neighbourhoods <- nia_crime_data %>%
  filter(!(AREA_NAME %in% nia_neighbourhoods))

# If this dataframe is empty, only NIA neighborhoods are included
print("Non-NIA neighborhoods in the data:")
print(only_nia_neighbourhoods)

# Test 2: Check for negative values in crime counts
negative_values <- nia_crime_data %>%
  select(ASSAULT, BIKETHEFT, BREAKENTER, HOMICIDE, ROBBERY, SHOOTING, THEFTFROMMV, THEFTOVER) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(. < 0)))

print("Number of negative values in crime columns:")
print(negative_values)

# Test 3: Summary statistics for key crime types
summary_statistics <- nia_crime_data %>%
  select(ASSAULT, BIKETHEFT, BREAKENTER, HOMICIDE, ROBBERY, SHOOTING, THEFTFROMMV, THEFTOVER) %>%
  summary()

print("Summary statistics for key crime types:")
print(summary_statistics)

# Test 4: Check for missing values
missing_values <- nia_crime_data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.))))

print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)
This version uses only functions from the tidyverse package, specifically dplyr and readr. The steps remain the same:

Test 1: Checks for any areas not in the list of NIA neighborhoods.
Test 2: Checks for negative values in the crime-related columns.
Test 3: Outputs summary statistics for crime data.
Test 4: Checks for missing values.
Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!

To perform time series analysis in R with your data, you can follow these steps:

1. Data Preparation:
Ensure your data is in a tidy format with one row per observation. You have the structure correct, but you need to check that your data is in a consistent format (no missing values or anomalies). Here's a sample of how to load your data:

r
Copy code
# Loading necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Reading in the data
crime_data <- read.csv("your_data_file.csv")

# Checking the structure of the data
glimpse(crime_data)
2. Converting to Time Series Format:
You'll need to reshape your data to make it suitable for time series analysis. First, convert the year column to a time object.

r
Copy code
# Convert year to numeric and filter for a specific neighborhood
crime_data$year <- as.numeric(crime_data$year)

# Filter for a specific neighborhood (for example, Beechborough-Greenbrook)
beechborough_data <- crime_data %>%
  filter(AREA_NAME == "beechborough-greenbrook")

# Check the structure
glimpse(beechborough_data)
3. Basic Time Series Analysis:
You can start with simple time series analysis using the ts() function in R for a specific crime type (e.g., Assault):

r
Copy code
# Creating a time series object for ASSAULT in Beechborough-Greenbrook
assault_ts <- ts(beechborough_data$ASSAULT, start=min(beechborough_data$year), frequency=1)

# Plotting the time series
plot(assault_ts, main="Assaults in Beechborough-Greenbrook", xlab="Year", ylab="Number of Assaults")
4. Decomposition of Time Series:
You can decompose the time series to see trends, seasonality, and residuals:

r
Copy code
# Decomposing the time series (if applicable for longer time frames)
assault_ts_decomp <- decompose(assault_ts)
plot(assault_ts_decomp)
5. Forecasting (ARIMA):
You can use the forecast package for ARIMA forecasting:

r
Copy code
# Installing and loading the forecast package
install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)

# Fitting an ARIMA model
assault_arima <- auto.arima(assault_ts)

# Forecasting for the next few years
assault_forecast <- forecast(assault_arima, h=5)
plot(assault_forecast)
6. Multiple Time Series:
If you want to analyze multiple crimes (like Assault, BIKETHEFT, etc.) across multiple neighborhoods, you can work with pivoted data:

r
Copy code
# Pivoting the data to long format if needed for multiple crimes analysis
long_crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("ASSAULT"):starts_with("THEFTOVER"), names_to = "crime_type", values_to = "crime_count")

# Filter for one neighborhood
beechborough_long <- long_crime_data %>%
  filter(AREA_NAME == "beechborough-greenbrook")

# Create a time series for each crime type
beechborough_crimes_ts <- beechborough_long %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(ts = list(ts(crime_count, start = min(year), frequency = 1)))

# Plotting example (Assault and BIKETHEFT comparison)
ggplot(beechborough_long, aes(x=year, y=crime_count, color=crime_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~crime_type, scales="free_y") +
  labs(title="Crime Trends in Beechborough-Greenbrook")
This provides a start for your analysis. Depending on your goals, you can move on to deeper analysis, such as seasonality adjustment, prediction intervals, or crime rate comparisons across different neighborhoods. Let me know if you need more specific guidance!

You're right! Using tidyverse, lubridate, and broom can offer a clean and efficient workflow for time series analysis without needing forecast. Here's how you can approach time series analysis with these libraries:

1. Data Preparation
Start by using tidyverse for data wrangling, and lubridate for working with dates. Make sure your year column is treated as a date or numeric object.

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Converting 'year' column to a numeric or date format
crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  mutate(year = ymd(paste0(year, "-01-01")))  # Treat year as a date
2. Time Series Data Wrangling
Now, organize the data so it's ready for analysis, focusing on the variables you want to model (e.g., ASSAULT and ASSAULT_RATE).

r
Copy code
# Example: Wrangling data for Assault in Beechborough-Greenbrook
beechborough_data <- crime_data %>%
  filter(AREA_NAME == "beechborough-greenbrook") %>%
  select(year, ASSAULT, ASSAULT_RATE)

# Plotting the data to see trends
ggplot(beechborough_data, aes(x=year, y=ASSAULT)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Assaults Over Time in Beechborough-Greenbrook", x = "Year", y = "Number of Assaults")
3. Linear Modeling with broom
You can create a linear model to assess the trend of crime over time. Use broom to tidy the results.

r
Copy code
# Create a linear model to predict assaults over time
assault_lm <- lm(ASSAULT ~ year, data = beechborough_data)

# Use broom to tidy the results
assault_lm_tidy <- broom::tidy(assault_lm)
assault_lm_glance <- broom::glance(assault_lm)

# View the results
print(assault_lm_tidy)
print(assault_lm_glance)

# Plotting the model with confidence intervals
ggplot(beechborough_data, aes(x=year, y=ASSAULT)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Linear Trend of Assaults in Beechborough-Greenbrook", x = "Year", y = "Assaults")
4. Predict Future Values
While broom and tidyverse do not directly provide forecasting, you can predict future values based on the linear trend.

r
Copy code
# Creating future years for prediction
future_years <- tibble(year = seq(as.Date("2024-01-01"), by = "year", length.out = 5))

# Predicting assaults in future years
future_assaults <- augment(assault_lm, newdata = future_years)

# Plotting actual vs predicted assaults
ggplot(beechborough_data, aes(x=year, y=ASSAULT)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = future_assaults, aes(x=year, y=.fitted), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Assault Predictions for Beechborough-Greenbrook", x = "Year", y = "Assaults")
5. Handling Multiple Crime Types
You can extend this approach to multiple crime types using a group_by approach:

r
Copy code
# Wrangling for multiple crime types
long_crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("ASSAULT"):starts_with("THEFTOVER"), names_to = "crime_type", values_to = "crime_count")

# Building a linear model for each crime type
crime_models <- long_crime_data %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  do(model = lm(crime_count ~ year, data = .)) %>%
  mutate(tidy_model = map(model, broom::tidy),
         glance_model = map(model, broom::glance))

# Unnesting to see the results
tidy_crime_models <- crime_models %>% unnest(tidy_model)
glance_crime_models <- crime_models %>% unnest(glance_model)

# Print model summaries
print(tidy_crime_models)
This approach keeps your workflow tidy and leverages modern R packages like tidyverse, lubridate, and broom for a streamlined time series analysis without the need for external forecasting libraries. Let me know if you need more details on any step!

Introduction
Urban crime impacts the safety, economy, and quality of life in cities worldwide. In Toronto, certain neighborhoods have historically faced higher crime rates and socio-economic challenges, leading to significant disparities. To address these issues, the City of Toronto launched the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS 2020) in 2014, designating 31 neighborhoods as Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs). This initiative aims to strengthen communities by investing in local services, infrastructure, and leadership, with the assumption that improving social and economic conditions will reduce crime.

However, the effectiveness of the NIA designation in reducing crime has not been fully evaluated, leaving a gap in understanding its true impact. While previous studies have explored how socio-economic interventions influence crime rates, there is limited empirical evidence specifically analyzing the long-term effects of Toronto's NIAs on various crime categories. This lack of evaluation hinders policymakers and urban planners from making informed decisions about resource allocation and program effectiveness.

This paper addresses this gap by investigating whether the designation of NIAs has effectively reduced crime rates in Toronto from 2014 to 2023. We analyze crime data across multiple categories—including assault, robbery, bike theft, break and enter, homicide, shooting, theft from motor vehicles, and theft over $5,000—to identify trends and assess the impact of the NIA initiative.

{r}
Copy code
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Read the crime data
crime_data <- read_csv("../data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")
Using linear regression models on time series data, we evaluate changes in crime rates within NIA neighborhoods over the nine-year period.

{r}
Copy code
# Prepare the data for analysis
crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(AREA_NAME, year),
    names_to = "crime_metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    metric = if_else(str_detect(crime_metric, "_RATE$"), "RATE", "COUNT"),
    crime_type = str_replace(crime_metric, "_RATE$", "")
  ) %>%
  filter(metric == "RATE") %>%
  select(AREA_NAME, year, crime_type, value)
Our findings reveal a significant decrease in robbery rates, suggesting that NIA initiatives may have contributed to reducing this type of violent crime. Conversely, theft from motor vehicles and theft over $5,000 have increased significantly, while other crime categories show no statistically significant changes. These results indicate that while NIAs may be effective in addressing certain crimes, they might not be adequately tackling property crimes.

Understanding these trends is crucial for urban planners and policymakers. By identifying which aspects of the NIA programs are effective and where improvements are needed, this study provides valuable insights for optimizing future urban planning and policy development. This contributes to strategies that more effectively reduce crime across different categories in Toronto's communities.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data sources and variables used. Section 3 outlines the methodology, including the statistical techniques applied. Section 4 presents the results of the analysis. Section 5 discusses the implications of the findings in the context of urban policy and community development. Section 6 concludes with recommendations for future initiatives and areas for further research.

Introduction
Urban crime affects safety, the economy, and quality of life globally. In Toronto, specific neighborhoods face persistent socio-economic challenges and higher crime rates. To mitigate these disparities, the City of Toronto introduced the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS 2020) in 2014, designating 31 neighborhoods as Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs). The initiative aims to enhance these communities through investments in services, infrastructure, and leadership, intending to reduce crime.

Despite these efforts, the effectiveness of NIA designations in reducing crime remains unclear. Existing studies provide little empirical evidence on the long-term impact of NIAs on various crime types. This lack of evaluation limits policymakers' ability to make informed decisions on resource allocation and program success.

This paper examines whether the NIA designation has reduced crime in Toronto between 2014 and 2023. We analyze trends in multiple crime categories—including assault, robbery, bike theft, and homicide—using time series data and linear regression models.

The findings show a significant reduction in robbery rates, suggesting that NIAs may be effective in reducing violent crimes. However, property crimes, like motor vehicle theft and theft over $5,000, have increased. These results highlight the need for targeted improvements in addressing property crimes.

This study provides critical insights for policymakers and urban planners, helping refine future strategies to more effectively reduce crime across different categories.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data sources and variables, Section 3 details the methodology, Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5 discusses implications. Section 6 concludes with recommendations for future policy and research.

# Introduction

Urban crime remains a pressing concern for cities worldwide, affecting the safety, economic stability, and overall quality of life for residents. In Toronto, certain neighborhoods have historically faced higher crime rates and socio-economic challenges compared to others. Recognizing the need to address these disparities, the City of Toronto launched the **Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS 2020)** in 2014. This initiative designated 31 neighborhoods as **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)** with the goal of directing resources and support to communities most in need.

The TSNS 2020 aims to strengthen these neighborhoods through investments in community services, infrastructure, and local leadership. The underlying assumption is that improving social and economic conditions will lead to safer communities and reduced crime rates. **However, the effectiveness of this strategy in curbing crime has not been fully evaluated.** With crime trends evolving and new challenges emerging—such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social dynamics—it is crucial to assess whether the NIA designation has made a tangible difference in reducing crime.

Previous studies have explored the relationship between socio-economic interventions and crime reduction, often highlighting the complexity of factors involved. For instance, community development programs can influence crime rates by improving employment opportunities, education, and social cohesion. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence specifically analyzing the impact of Toronto's NIAs on crime over an extended period.

**This paper investigates whether the designation of NIAs has been effective in reducing crime rates in Toronto from 2014 to 2023.** We analyze crime data across multiple categories—including assault, robbery, bike theft, break and enter, homicide, shooting, theft from motor vehicles, and theft over \$5,000—to identify trends and correlations with the NIA initiative.

Coming out of the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 election largely upheld the status quo and did not feature ambitious policy platforms. Voter turnout across the city fell to 30%- the lowest in the city’s history since amalgamation in 1997, with turnout ranging on a ward-by-ward basis from 22% to 38% (Marshall 2023; Warren 2022). Individual turnout by ward depended on a number of factors, including the accessibility of polling locations within subdivisions to cast a ballot. The City of Toronto Elections (2023b) defines a ward as “a geographical area represented by a member of Council.” Following Premier Doug Ford’s decision in the summer of 2018 to cut down the number of wards in the city to match federal and provincial riding boundaries, there are currently 25 wards in the City of Toronto (Lucas and McGregor 2021). Subdivisions are defined by the City of Toronto (Data 2023) as “…. geographical area[s within a ward] designated by the City Clerk.” Previous studies concentrating on large cities in the United States, including Atlanta revealed that having polling locations in close proximity to a voter’s home bolsters turnout and even minor changes in placement of a polling location can have significant impact on a voter’s decision to cast a ballot (Haspel and Knotts 2005). There has been little research into the impact of polling location placement in relation to election turnout, especially in Canadian cities like Toronto and this paper will contribute to the investigation of this phenomenon. To examine the impact of subdivision placement on voter turnout, this paper is organized into the following sections: Data, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. In the Data section, I discuss the nature of the spreadsheet obtained through the City of Toronto’s OpenDataToronto Library (Gelfand 2022) and the steps I took to clean and analyze the data. The Results section highlights trends found during the analysis process, while the Discussion section further evaluates the trends and presents insight. Lastly, the Conclusion section summarizes the main f indings from this paper.

# Introduction

Urban crime significantly affects safety, economic stability, and quality of life. To address these challenges, the **City of Toronto** launched the **Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS 2020)** in 2014, identifying 31 **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)** that required focused resources.

The goal of TSNS 2020 is to improve social and economic conditions in these neighborhoods, assuming that such improvements will reduce crime. **However, the effectiveness of this strategy remains under-examined.** With evolving crime trends and external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to evaluate whether NIA designation has significantly reduced crime from 2014 to 2023.

**This paper investigates** the impact of NIA designation on crime rates across Toronto. We analyze crime data for categories including assault, robbery, bike theft, break and enter, homicide, shooting, and motor vehicle theft, identifying trends and correlations with the NIA initiative.

**Results show** a notable reduction in robbery rates, suggesting success in some areas. However, **theft from motor vehicles** and **theft over $5,000** have increased. Mixed outcomes indicate that while NIAs may be effective in addressing certain crimes, further intervention is needed for others.

The paper is structured as follows: **Section 2** presents the data sources, **Section 3** outlines the methodology, **Section 4** discusses the results, and **Section 5** offers conclusions and recommendations.

# Introduction

Urban crime has far-reaching effects on safety, economic stability, and overall quality of life. In response, the **City of Toronto** launched the **Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS 2020)** in 2014, identifying 31 **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)** to direct resources to communities most in need. 

TSNS 2020 aims to improve social and economic conditions in these neighborhoods, with the expectation that these efforts will reduce crime. **However, the actual effectiveness of this strategy remains under-assessed**, especially after years of targeted investments and efforts. With crime trends evolving and external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic impacting neighborhoods, it is crucial to determine whether NIAs have achieved meaningful crime reductions and to guide future urban planning.

**This paper investigates** whether NIA designation has led to a decrease in crime rates in Toronto from 2014 to 2023. Crime data was sourced from neighborhood profiles and matched with the NIA file to extract the designated areas. After cleaning and restructuring the data, we analyzed trends across multiple crime categories—including assault, robbery, bike theft, break and enter, homicide, shooting, and motor vehicle theft—using statistical models to evaluate the impact of NIA efforts.

**The results reveal** a notable reduction in robbery rates, suggesting NIA interventions may have been effective in this area. However, **theft from motor vehicles** and **theft over $5,000** have risen significantly, indicating that some crime categories have not benefited from the initiative. These mixed results underscore the need for continued efforts and adjustments to the program.

Beyond crime, the NIA initiative is intended to produce broader positive outcomes, making it a significant project for informing future urban development and resource allocation. Evaluating its success is essential for ensuring that such strategies lead to lasting improvements.

This paper is structured as follows: **Section 2** discusses the data collection and cleaning process, **Section 3** explains the methodology and statistical models used, **Section 4** presents the results of the analysis, and **Section 5** discusses the broader implications for urban policy and concludes with recommendations for future planning.
Key Changes:
Data Process Clarified: I added details about how you sourced, cleaned, and analyzed the crime data based on neighborhood profiles and NIA files.
Significance of the Project: Highlighted that NIA is not solely about crime but aims for broader positive outcomes, making it crucial for future urban planning.
Logical Structure: The structuring clearly flows from data collection, analysis, results, and their implications, guiding the reader step-by-step through your investigation.
This version emphasizes the relevance of the NIA initiative beyond crime reduction and structures the paper’s goals clearly.

Data
A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. The broader context of the dataset should be discussed. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships between the variables. If this becomes too detailed, then appendices could be used.

one of goof example with perfect looks like this
# Data {#sec-data}
## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}
This report utilizes data published by the City of Toronto's Facilities Management Division on the city's Open Data Portal and is titled "Renewable Energy Installations" [@opendatatoronto]. Specifically, the Facilities Management Division collected the locations of installed renewable energy systems on city-owned buildings such as photovoltaic, solar pool heating, and geothermal installations. The dataset was last updated Apr 22, 2022, but only contains observations from 2010 until 2019. The aforementioned increased relevance of renewable energy in Toronto's combat with climate change gave rise to this dataset. However, due to the data collection method and the Facilities Management Division as the primary data collector, a key limitation of this dataset is that it only includes city divisions, but not all city agencies or corporations. This highlights a key difficulty of measuring data related to renewable energy system installation, since there are different jurisdictions in who is responsible for which installation. No personally identifiable information is included, since the data collected is only on installed renewable energy systems, preserving the confidentiality of individuals associated with the installations.

The dataset was analyzed using R [@citeR] and downloaded using the R package opendatatoronto [@citeopendatatoronto]. Additionally, the packages tidyverse [@citetidyverse], lubridate [@citelubridate], stringr [@citestringr], sf [@citesf], and tmap [@citetmap] have been used in data cleaning and visualization.

## Data Characteristics {#sec-datachar}

The raw dataset contained 100 unique observations and 41 variable columns, most of which with either constant or missing values. Most columns referred to geospatial data and were deemed beyond the scope of this report. In the first basic cleaning steps, only certain variables of interest were selected: ID, type of installation, date of installation, size of installation, and the location (given by coordinates). From the date of installation, I created an additional year of installation variable. From the location, the two colummns latitude and longitude were extracted, for simpler analysis. A glimpse of the final cleaned dataset can be seen in @tbl-cleaneddata.

cleaned_data %>% head() %>% kable()


### Size of Installation
The size of installation represents the power capacity of each installation, measured in kilowatts (kW). All installations fall within the range of 1.2 kW to 500.0 kW. As summarized in Table 1 (@tbl-sizesummary), the mean size of installations is 88.1 kW, showcasing the average power capacity across the dataset. The median size, a robust measure of central tendency, is slightly lower at 68.5 kW. The difference between the mean and median suggests the presence of outliers or a skewed distribution. Indeed, the histogram (@fig-sizehisto)  reveals a right-skewed distribution, indicating a higher concentration of installations at the lower end of the size spectrum and very few observations at the upper end of the spectrum. The standard deviation of 102.82 kW reinforces this variability in installation sizes.

#| label: tbl-sizesummary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics of the Size of City-Owned Renewable Energy Installations in Toronto in kilowatts (kW)"

cleaned_data %>% ggplot(aes (x= size)) + geom_histogram(bins=15) + labs(x="Size (kW)") + theme_minimal()

### Type of Installation
Type of Installation (type) refers to whether the system falls under the FIT or microFIT program (with very few installations being classified as *storage*. FIT, or "Feed-In Tariff", is a program developed by the Ontario Power Authority which guarantees long-term financing and contracting for program participants, meant to incentivize the use of renewable energy sources [@FIT]. microFIT is part of the wider FIT program, but for smaller installations (10 kW or less). 

Taking a closer look at the installation types in @fig-typebar, we see that the majority of installations are of the FIT type, followed by microFIT, and only 2 storage installations. This is consistent with the size distribution discussed in the previous section, since microFIT only applies to installations with less than 10 kW.

cleaned_data %>% ggplot(aes (x= factor(type))) + geom_bar(width=0.7) + labs(x="Type") + theme_minimal()


### Time of Installation

Date of installation, with the variable name date, takes dates from the 31st of March 2010, to the 1st of January 2019. As seen in @fig-yearinstallation, the distribution is left-skewed with the highest number of new renewable energy systems installed was in 2018 with 31, whereas the lowest number of new systems was in 2019 with 1. While the original dataset was most recently updated in 2022, there are no entries beyond the single new installation in 2019. Since there has been no officially released statement by the government indicating the stop of installing renewable energy systems, we can make the inference that since the beginning of 2019, there has simply not been any new data collected by the City of Toronto's Facilities Management Division. Therefore, we should be careful extrapolating beyond the timeframe of 2010 to 2018.

{r}
#| label: fig-yearinstallation
#| fig-cap: "Count of new City-Owned Renewable Energy Installations in Toronto per year between 2010 and 2019"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

cleaned_data %>% ggplot(aes (x= factor(year))) + geom_histogram(stat = "count") + labs(x="Year")


@fig-yearinstallation shows a clear upwards trend in the number of newly installed renewable energy systems per year. Until 2016, the number of new systems did not exceed 10, with the exception of 2015, which saw 14 new installations. However, there is a sudden spike in 2017 with over 20 new installations - a development that was also maintained in 2018 with over 30 new installations. Thus, more than half of all systems in the designated timeframe were installed in 2017 and 2018 alone.

### Geographical Distribution of Installations
The location of an installation is given by its coordinates, which all fall between the boundaries of Toronto. @fig-locations shows a rather even distribution of installations across the city, however with notably low densities in the Etobicoke Centre, Scarborough-Rouge Park, and Don Valley city wards.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This paper uses data compiled by the City of Toronto's Police Department, available via the city's Open Data Portal. The dataset is titled "Crime Rates Over Time in NIA Neighborhoods" and encompasses various crime statistics from 2014 to 2023. The selected timeframe allows for the examination of crime trends both before and after the implementation of the **Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS 2020)**. The dataset includes comprehensive data on crime categories such as assault, bike theft, break and enter, homicide, robbery, shooting, theft from motor vehicles, and theft over \$5,000, reflecting the frequency of these incidents within the Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs).

The measurement of crime data involves standardized police reporting and classification systems, ensuring consistency across the dataset. However, a limitation is its restriction to reported crimes, potentially underestimating actual crime rates due to non-reporting.

The dataset was analyzed using R [@citeR], facilitated by packages like `tidyverse` [@citetidyverse] for data manipulation and `ggplot2` [@citeggplot2] for visualization.

## Data Characteristics {#sec-datachar}

The dataset consists of annual crime rate observations across the designated NIAs. Initial exploration revealed varying patterns of crime rates, with some categories showing fluctuations and others a more steady trend. This variability necessitated a deeper analysis of each crime type, considering the socio-economic and environmental factors influencing these patterns.

About Neighbourhood Crime Rates
This dataset includes the Crime Data by Neighbourhood. Counts are available for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. Data also includes the crime rate per 100,000 population calculated using the population estimates provided by Environics Analytics.

Following the standard definition by StatsCan, crime rate is calculated as the crime count per 100,000 population* per year. This metric facilitates the comparisons of crime between geographic areas with different size of populations. Comparing to crime count, crime rate provides a fairer comparison of the crime over time by taking into account the change in population in the region.

Note: Fields have been included for the new 158 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure

*Population figures reflect only the resident population of a region. The temporary population such as the commuters and business patrons are not included.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This study leverages two critical datasets published on the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal:

1. **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: Published by Toronto Police Services, this dataset holds a "Gold" data quality score and was last updated on January 11, 2024. It includes crime data by neighborhood with counts for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. Crime rates are calculated per 100,000 population annually, allowing for consistent comparisons across different population sizes and neighborhoods over time. This metric is aligned with StatsCan's standard definition, facilitating an accurate comparison of crime trends irrespective of population changes.

2. **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Managed by Social Development, Finance & Administration, this dataset with a "Silver" data quality score was refreshed last on December 19, 2022. It identifies 31 out of 140 neighborhoods as NIAs under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), aimed at addressing inequities across several well-being indicators. This dataset includes geographical mappings and is crucial for identifying areas where targeted interventions could potentially influence crime rates and community health.

The combination of these datasets enables a detailed examination of crime trends within the NIAs and facilitates an understanding of the spatial distribution of crime and socio-economic improvements post TSNS2020 implementation.

## Data Characteristics {#sec-datachar}

The crime data were parsed to focus on annual crime rates from 2014 to 2023 for each neighborhood, while the NIA data were used to identify the specific neighborhoods for detailed analysis. Given the comprehensive nature of the crime dataset and the targeted approach of the NIA dataset, the analysis covers both the scope of crime types and the geographical focus areas of city-led interventions.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This study utilizes two datasets from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal:

1. **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: Published by Toronto Police Services, this dataset includes annual crime counts and rates per 100,000 population for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges from 2014 to 2023. Crime rates are calculated using population estimates from Environics Analytics, conforming to StatsCan's standard definition for equitable comparison across neighborhoods.

2. **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Published by Social Development, Finance & Administration, this dataset identifies 31 NIAs targeted for enhancements under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020. It includes geographical mappings based on the 2011 Census Tracts and is essential for pinpointing intervention zones.

## Data Processing and Characteristics {#sec-datachar}

Both datasets were merged using the `AREA_NAME` attribute to align crime data with NIA locations. This study focuses on the period from 2014 to 2023, allowing for analysis before and after the TSNS2020 initiation. Records were sorted by year and `AREA_NAME` to maintain chronological order and facilitate trend analysis.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This analysis employs two datasets from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal:

1. **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: Authored by Toronto Police Services, this dataset scores a "Gold" in data quality and was last updated on January 11, 2024. It provides annual crime data for various offenses, including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, among others, from 2014 to 2023. The dataset calculates crime rates per 100,000 population, aiding in consistent crime trend analysis across varying neighborhood populations.

2. **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Curated by Social Development, Finance & Administration with a "Silver" data quality score and last refreshed on December 19, 2022. This dataset identifies 31 out of 140 neighborhoods designated as NIAs, focusing on regions with marked social and economic disparities.

Data from these sources is crucial for analyzing the effectiveness of the TSNS2020, which began implementation in March 2014.

## Data Processing {#sec-dataprocessing}

Upon acquiring the datasets, the initial step involved merging the crime statistics with NIA designations based on the `AREA_NAME`. This merged dataset was then sorted by `year` and `AREA_NAME`, ensuring a chronological order for analysis. Notably, data before 2014 was unavailable, presenting a limitation in assessing pre-TSNS2020 conditions. Records with missing (`NA`) or zero values were excluded to maintain data integrity.

```{r}
# Load and prepare the data
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(broom)

crime_data <- read_csv("data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")
crime_data$year <- as.numeric(crime_data$year)  # Ensure 'year' is numeric

# Merging and cleaning the data
crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  inner_join(nia_data, by = "AREA_NAME") %>%
  arrange(AREA_NAME, year) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Incidents) & Incidents > 0)

# Display the cleaned data structure
print("Cleaned Data Structure:")
print(head(crime_data))
Time Series Analysis {#sec-timeseries}
To assess the impact of the TSNS2020 initiative over time, a linear trend analysis was conducted for each crime type. The tidyverse suite was utilized for data manipulation, with broom for modeling.

    crime_type = str_replace(crime_metric, "_RATE$", "")
  ) %>%
  filter(metric == "RATE") %>%
  select(AREA_NAME, year, crime_type, value)

# Conducting time series analysis
ts_results <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    data = list(data.frame(year = year, avg_rate = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))),

title: "Did Toronto’s Neighbourhood Improvement Areas Curb Crime?"
subtitle: "An Analysis of Crime Reduction from 2014 to 2023"
author: 
  - Harsh M Pareek
thanks: "Code and data are available at: https://github.com/HarshMPareek/Project1"

abstract: "This study examines whether Toronto's Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) have effectively reduced crime since designated in 2014. By analyzing crime rates over several years since designation in these communities, we found that robberies have significantly decreased, but thefts from motor vehicles and thefts over $5,000 have significantly increased. These findings suggest that while NIAs may help lower certain violent crimes, they might not be addressing property and other crimes effectively. Understanding these trends is crucial for urban planners and policymakers to improve community programs and enhance the effectiveness of NIAs in reducing all types of crime."

A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. The broader context of the dataset should be discussed. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships between the variables. If this becomes too detailed, then appendices could be used.

Given the guidelines and criteria outlined in the rubric for writing the "Data" section of your paper, you can structure this part to highlight the dataset’s attributes, the cleaning and preparation process, and the methodological rigor that underpins your study. Here’s a structured way to draft this section effectively:

qmd
Copy code
# Data {#sec-data}

This section details the datasets used in the study, focusing on their origin, characteristics, and the methods employed for data cleaning and analysis.

## Data Source and Context {#sec-datasource}

The primary dataset for this analysis, "Neighbourhood Crime Rates," was sourced from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. This dataset is maintained by Toronto Police Services and offers detailed crime statistics by neighborhood from 2014 to 2023. It includes the following crime types: Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. These crime rates are calculated per 100,000 population, allowing for adjusted comparisons across areas with varying population sizes, which is crucial for accurate trend analysis over time.

The secondary dataset, "Neighbourhood Improvement Areas," also from the Open Data Portal and published by Social Development, Finance & Administration, identifies areas within Toronto designated for targeted social and economic improvements. These areas, chosen based on a range of well-being indicators, align with the locations and timescales of the crime data, enabling a focused analysis on the impact of urban improvement policies.

No alternative datasets were utilized as these provided the most comprehensive and directly relevant metrics required for analyzing the effectiveness of the Neighbourhood Improvement Areas initiative.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning {#sec-datapreparation}

Prior to analysis, the datasets underwent several cleaning steps to ensure accuracy and relevance of the data for this study:

- **Merging Datasets**: The crime data was merged with the Neighbourhood Improvement Areas data based on `AREA_NAME`, ensuring that each area’s crime statistics were accurately matched with its NIA status.

- **Filtering and Sorting**: Data were filtered to exclude records with missing or zero values, which could skew analysis results. Additionally, the datasets were sorted by `AREA_NAME` and `year` to facilitate chronological analysis.

- **Variable Construction**: For each crime type, rates per 100,000 population were calculated to standardize the data across neighborhoods with differing population sizes.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Preparation {#sec-datasource}

The datasets utilized in this analysis were sourced from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal, which includes two key datasets:

1. **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: This dataset, published by Toronto Police Services, offers crime statistics categorized by types such as Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, among others, across all Toronto neighbourhoods from 2014 onward.

2. **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Published by Social Development, Finance & Administration, this dataset outlines areas designated for targeted socio-economic improvements.

### Data Preparation

Data preparation involved the following steps, executed using R programming with the `tidyverse` and `janitor` packages for data manipulation:

- **Standardization**: AREA_NAME in both datasets was standardized to lowercase to ensure consistency during data merging.

- **Filtering and Joining**: The crime data was filtered to include only those records that correspond to NIA areas by matching the AREA_NAME field between the NIA dataset and the crime dataset.

- **Reshaping**: Crime data were reshaped from a wide format to a long format. This restructuring facilitated easier manipulation and analysis of crime types over various years.

- **Aggregation**: The crime data was then aggregated to calculate total counts for each crime type per year per NIA area, ensuring that the analysis could be conducted on a yearly basis.

# Data {#sec-data}
## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}
This report utilizes data published by the City of Toronto's Facilities Management Division on the city's Open Data Portal and is titled "Renewable Energy Installations" [@opendatatoronto]. Specifically, the Facilities Management Division collected the locations of installed renewable energy systems on city-owned buildings such as photovoltaic, solar pool heating, and geothermal installations. The dataset was last updated Apr 22, 2022, but only contains observations from 2010 until 2019. The aforementioned increased relevance of renewable energy in Toronto's combat with climate change gave rise to this dataset. However, due to the data collection method and the Facilities Management Division as the primary data collector, a key limitation of this dataset is that it only includes city divisions, but not all city agencies or corporations. This highlights a key difficulty of measuring data related to renewable energy system installation, since there are different jurisdictions in who is responsible for which installation. No personally identifiable information is included, since the data collected is only on installed renewable energy systems, preserving the confidentiality of individuals associated with the installations.

The dataset was analyzed using R [@citeR] and downloaded using the R package opendatatoronto [@citeopendatatoronto]. Additionally, the packages tidyverse [@citetidyverse], lubridate [@citelubridate], stringr [@citestringr], sf [@citesf], and tmap [@citetmap] have been used in data cleaning and visualization.

## Data Characteristics {#sec-datachar}

The raw dataset contained 100 unique observations and 41 variable columns, most of which with either constant or missing values. Most columns referred to geospatial data and were deemed beyond the scope of this report. In the first basic cleaning steps, only certain variables of interest were selected: ID, type of installation, date of installation, size of installation, and the location (given by coordinates). From the date of installation, I created an additional year of installation variable. From the location, the two colummns latitude and longitude were extracted, for simpler analysis. A glimpse of the final cleaned dataset can be seen in @tbl-cleaneddata.

cleaned_data %>% head() %>% kable()


### Size of Installation
The size of installation represents the power capacity of each installation, measured in kilowatts (kW). All installations fall within the range of 1.2 kW to 500.0 kW. As summarized in Table 1 (@tbl-sizesummary), the mean size of installations is 88.1 kW, showcasing the average power capacity across the dataset. The median size, a robust measure of central tendency, is slightly lower at 68.5 kW. The difference between the mean and median suggests the presence of outliers or a skewed distribution. Indeed, the histogram (@fig-sizehisto)  reveals a right-skewed distribution, indicating a higher concentration of installations at the lower end of the size spectrum and very few observations at the upper end of the spectrum. The standard deviation of 102.82 kW reinforces this variability in installation sizes.

{r}
#| label: tbl-sizesummary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics of the Size of City-Owned Renewable Energy Installations in Toronto in kilowatts (kW)"

#| fig-align: 'center'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

cleaned_data %>% ggplot(aes (x= size)) + geom_histogram(bins=15) + labs(x="Size (kW)") + theme_minimal()

### Type of Installation
Type of Installation (type) refers to whether the system falls under the FIT or microFIT program (with very few installations being classified as *storage*. FIT, or "Feed-In Tariff", is a program developed by the Ontario Power Authority which guarantees long-term financing and contracting for program participants, meant to incentivize the use of renewable energy sources [@FIT]. microFIT is part of the wider FIT program, but for smaller installations (10 kW or less). 

Taking a closer look at the installation types in @fig-typebar, we see that the majority of installations are of the FIT type, followed by microFIT, and only 2 storage installations. This is consistent with the size distribution discussed in the previous section, since microFIT only applies to installations with less than 10 kW.

{r}
#| label: fig-typebar
#| fig-cap: "Count of Types of City-Owned Renewable Energy Installations in Toronto"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

cleaned_data %>% ggplot(aes (x= factor(type))) + geom_bar(width=0.7) + labs(x="Type") + theme_minimal()


### Time of Installation

Date of installation, with the variable name date, takes dates from the 31st of March 2010, to the 1st of January 2019. As seen in @fig-yearinstallation, the distribution is left-skewed with the highest number of new renewable energy systems installed was in 2018 with 31, whereas the lowest number of new systems was in 2019 with 1. While the original dataset was most recently updated in 2022, there are no entries beyond the single new installation in 2019. Since there has been no officially released statement by the government indicating the stop of installing renewable energy systems, we can make the inference that since the beginning of 2019, there has simply not been any new data collected by the City of Toronto's Facilities Management Division. Therefore, we should be careful extrapolating beyond the timeframe of 2010 to 2018.

{r}
#| label: fig-yearinstallation
#| fig-cap: "Count of new City-Owned Renewable Energy Installations in Toronto per year between 2010 and 2019"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

cleaned_data %>% ggplot(aes (x= factor(year))) + geom_histogram(stat = "count") + labs(x="Year")


@fig-yearinstallation shows a clear upwards trend in the number of newly installed renewable energy systems per year. Until 2016, the number of new systems did not exceed 10, with the exception of 2015, which saw 14 new installations. However, there is a sudden spike in 2017 with over 20 new installations - a development that was also maintained in 2018 with over 30 new installations. Thus, more than half of all systems in the designated timeframe were installed in 2017 and 2018 alone.

### Geographical Distribution of Installations
The location of an installation is given by its coordinates, which all fall between the boundaries of Toronto. @fig-locations shows a rather even distribution of installations across the city, however with notably low densities in the Etobicoke Centre, Scarborough-Rouge Park, and Don Valley city wards.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This study utilizes two primary datasets provided by the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal:

- **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: This dataset, maintained by Toronto Police Services, records annual crime statistics from 2014 to 2023. It includes detailed counts for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. Each crime type is expressed per 100,000 population, allowing for standardized comparisons across different neighborhood sizes and over time.

- **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Published by the Social Development, Finance & Administration division, this dataset identifies designated areas targeted for socio-economic improvements under the TSNS2020 initiative. 

### Why These Datasets?

The selection of these datasets was motivated by the absence of similar reliable data prior to 2014, making it impossible to perform a comprehensive time series analysis starting from the implementation of the NIAs in March 2014. These datasets are the most complete and authoritative sources available for understanding the impact of Toronto's policy interventions on neighborhood crime rates.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

The preparation of the data involved several key steps to ensure it was suitable for analysis:

```{r setup-code, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

nia_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/neighbourhood_improvement_areas.csv")
crime_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/neighbourhood_crime_rates.csv")

# Standardizing and merging the data
crime_in_nia <- crime_data %>%
  mutate(AREA_NAME = tolower(AREA_NAME)) %>%
  inner_join(nia_data %>% mutate(AREA_NAME = tolower(AREA_NAME)), by = "AREA_NAME")

# Reshaping the crime data to long format
crime_long <- crime_in_nia %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("crime_"),
    names_to = "crime_type",
    values_to = "count"
  ) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_extract(name, "\\d{4}")))

# Cleaning and summarizing the data
crime_summary <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(AREA_NAME, year, crime_type) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

write_csv(crime_summary, "data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")
Data Characteristics and Analysis {#sec-datachar}
The cleaned data includes annual crime statistics for each designated NIA. To understand the changes over time and the effectiveness of the NIAs, summary statistics and graphs were generated:

{r
Copy code
crime_summary %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarise(
    Average = mean(total_count),
    Median = median(total_count),
    Standard_Deviation = sd(total_count)
  ) %>%
  kable()
Summary Statistics
The following table summarizes the average, median, and standard deviation for each crime type within the NIAs, illustrating the distribution and central tendencies of the crime rates.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This study leverages two datasets provided by the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal:

- **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: Maintained by Toronto Police Services, this dataset includes detailed crime statistics such as Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. The data spans from 2014 to 2023 and allows for analysis of trends over time due to its annual update frequency.

- **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Published by the Social Development, Finance & Administration division, this dataset identifies neighborhoods targeted for socio-economic improvements under the TSNS2020 initiative. 

### Selection of Datasets

The choice of these datasets was crucial due to the alignment with the initiation of NIAs in 2014, which enables a direct assessment of the impacts post-implementation. Although earlier data would have provided a more extended pre-implementation view, such data was not available, making these datasets the most comprehensive resources for conducting this time series analysis.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

The datasets were prepared and cleaned using the following methods:

- **Standardization and Merging**: AREA_NAME fields from both datasets were standardized to lowercase to ensure consistency. The datasets were then merged based on these area names, focusing solely on areas designated as NIAs.

- **Reshaping**: The crime data were transformed from a wide format to a long format to facilitate easier manipulation and analysis of crime types across different years.

- **Aggregation**: The crime data was aggregated to calculate the total counts for each crime type per year within each NIA, providing a basis for detailed trend analysis.

### Summary Statistics and Graphical Analysis

The following R code chunk was used to generate summary statistics and create visualizations to display the trends and distribution of crime data across NIAs:

```{r summary-and-graphics}

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Measurement {#sec-datasource}

This study uses two datasets from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal:

- **Neighbourhood Crime Rates**: Managed by Toronto Police Services, this dataset includes crime statistics such as Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges from 2014 to 2023. It offers annual counts per 100,000 population for each crime type, allowing for standardized comparison across different neighborhood sizes.

- **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Published by the Social Development, Finance & Administration division, this dataset identifies neighborhoods designated for targeted socio-economic improvements under the TSNS2020 initiative.

### Selection of Datasets

These datasets were chosen because of their relevance to the study’s objective of assessing crime trends post-implementation of NIAs in 2014. Data prior to 2014 was not available, making this dataset the most comprehensive option for performing time series analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of NIAs.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

The cleaning and preparation process involved:

- **Standardizing and Merging**: The `AREA_NAME` field in both datasets was standardized to lowercase to ensure consistency. The crime dataset was then filtered to include only areas designated as NIAs. Both datasets were merged based on `AREA_NAME`.

- **Reshaping and Aggregation**: The crime data was reshaped from wide format to long format to facilitate analysis across years and crime types. Aggregation was performed to compute total crime counts for each crime type annually within each NIA.

### Summary Statistics and Data Characteristics

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the crime data, including average, median, and standard deviation for each crime type across all NIAs. These statistics provide insights into the overall distribution and variability of crime rates across different areas.

```{r summary-and-graphics, include=TRUE}

    values_to = "count"
  ) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_extract(name, "\\d{4}"))) %>%
  group_by(AREA_NAME, year, crime_type) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Summary statistics
summary_stats <- prepared_data %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarise(
    Average = mean(total_count),
    Median = median(total_count),
    Standard_Deviation = sd(total_count)
  )
kable(summary_stats, caption = "Table 1: Summary Statistics of Crime Data Across NIAs")

# Trend graph
ggplot(prepared_data, aes(x = year, y = total_count, color = crime_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Crime Trends Across NIAs (2014-2023)", x = "Year", y = "Crime Rate") +
  theme_minimal()
As seen in Table 1, the average crime rates across different NIAs vary significantly depending on the type of crime, with violent crimes like Assault having higher averages compared to property crimes like Auto Theft. The median and standard deviation statistics further reveal variations in crime distribution and indicate the presence of outliers in certain crime categories.

Graphical Analysis
Figure 1 presents the trends in crime rates across the NIAs from 2014 to 2023. The visualization highlights which crime types have seen reductions or increases over time, offering insights into the effectiveness of the socio-economic interventions under the TSNS2020 initiative.

Measurement Implementation {#sec-measurement}
Crime rates per 100,000 population are used as the primary measurement metric to normalize crime counts and allow for standardized comparisons between neighborhoods of different population sizes. This measure is consistent with StatsCan's guidelines and ensures that crime rate fluctuations over time reflect actual trends rather than changes in population. The aggregation of crime data by year and area further allows for meaningful analysis of crime trends over time, offering a robust basis for evaluating the NIA initiative’s effectiveness.

These methods provide a reliable approach to examining the impact of NIAs on neighborhood crime rates and help inform policymakers on the success or limitations of these targeted interventions.

Crime rates are calculated per 100,000 population to enable standardized comparisons across neighborhoods with different population sizes.

- **Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs)**: Published by the Social Development, Finance & Administration division, this dataset identifies areas in Toronto that have been designated as NIAs under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), aimed at addressing socio-economic disparities.

### Selection of Datasets

These datasets were selected because they align with the timeline and objectives of this study, which seeks to evaluate the effect of the NIA designation on crime rates since the initiative's inception in 2014. Data prior to 2014 was unavailable, but the existing data still allows for a meaningful time series analysis of crime trends.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

The data cleaning and preparation process involved the following steps:

1. **Standardization and Merging**: The `AREA_NAME` field in both datasets was standardized to lowercase to ensure consistency across the datasets. The crime data was then filtered to include only neighborhoods designated as NIAs, and the datasets were merged based on `AREA_NAME`.

2. **Reshaping and Aggregation**: Crime data was transformed from wide format to long format for easier manipulation, allowing the analysis to be carried out across different crime types and years. Aggregation was performed to compute total crime counts for each crime type annually within each NIA.

### Summary Statistics and Graphical Analysis

The following code block was used to generate summary statistics (Table 1) and a visual representation of crime trends over time (Figure 1). The summary statistics offer insights into the central tendencies and variability of crime rates across the NIAs, while the trend graph highlights the changes in crime rates from 2014 to 2023.

  theme_minimal()
Data Summary
As presented in Table 1, the summary statistics show the central tendencies and variability in crime rates for different types of crimes across the NIAs. For example, the average crime rates for offenses like Assault and Robbery are significantly higher than for other crimes such as Auto Theft and Homicide. This distribution highlights the varying levels of crime in these neighborhoods and provides a baseline for evaluating changes over time.

Graphical Analysis
Figure 1 shows the trends in crime rates across different crime categories within NIAs from 2014 to 2023. Some crime types, such as Robbery, show a noticeable decline over time, while others, such as Theft from Motor Vehicles, have seen an increase. These trends provide a visual context for the effects of socio-economic interventions under the TSNS2020 initiative.

Measurement Implementation {#sec-measurement}
The primary measurement used in this study is the crime rate per 100,000 population, which ensures that crime levels are comparable across neighborhoods with different population sizes. This metric is standard in crime analysis, providing a consistent and fair comparison of crime trends over time. The aggregation of crime data by year and crime type allows for meaningful insights into the effectiveness of neighborhood interventions in curbing specific types of crime.

By focusing on crime rates rather than raw counts, this analysis offers a clear view of the changes in neighborhood safety over time, helping policymakers make data-driven decisions about future interventions.

I understand your frustration, and I want to help you get the best possible result. Here's a more refined prompt you can use to ask a more advanced AI for assistance. This prompt clearly explains the dataset, the cleaning process, the goals, and the necessary steps for generating output like tables and graphs. Feel free to adjust any specifics:

Prompt:

I am working on an analysis of Toronto’s Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) and their impact on crime rates from 2014 to 2023. I have two datasets from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal:

Neighbourhood Crime Rates: This dataset provides annual crime counts for offenses such as Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. The crime rates are standardized per 100,000 population to ensure fair comparisons across neighborhoods.

Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs): This dataset identifies areas in Toronto that have been designated as NIAs under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), aimed at improving socio-economic conditions.

I have already cleaned and merged the data as follows:

Standardized AREA_NAME fields in both datasets to lowercase for consistency.
Filtered the crime dataset to include only records for NIA-designated neighborhoods.
Reshaped the crime data from wide format to long format to allow easier manipulation across different crime types and years.
Aggregated the crime data by NIA, year, and crime type to compute total counts for each crime category annually.
My Request:
I need to structure a section in my research paper that explains the following:

Data Source and Selection:

Why I chose these datasets (focus on the 2014 NIA designation and absence of pre-2014 data).
The significance of these datasets for understanding the impact of the NIA initiative on crime trends.
Data Preparation:

A concise explanation of how I cleaned and prepared the data (focus on merging, filtering, reshaping, and aggregating without too many technical details).
Summary Statistics and Graphs:

I need summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the different crime types across NIAs.
I also want to present a trend graph showing changes in crime rates over time (from 2014 to 2023) for each crime type.
Cross-reference Table 1 for summary statistics and Figure 1 for the crime trend graph.
Measurement Implementation:

A clear explanation of why crime rates per 100,000 population are used (to standardize comparisons across neighborhoods with different populations).
How this measurement approach helps assess the impact of socio-economic interventions.
Please generate a concise and direct "Data" section that fits these requirements, and make sure that it’s accessible to non-technical readers, with necessary cross-references to Table 1 and Figure 1. You can include the code to generate the summary statistics and graphs, but it should not appear in the final text visible to readers.

Key Details to Include in Code (But Hidden from Readers):

Data loading and cleaning (without showing every detail, just the final output for tables and graphs).
Table 1: Summary statistics of crime data (mean, median, standard deviation).
Figure 1: Trend graph showing crime rates for each crime type from 2014 to 2023.
This prompt should guide a more advanced AI to give you the clear and concise "Data" section you're looking for, including the necessary explanations, summary statistics, and visualizations. Let me know if you need further refinement!

The error indicates that the column CRIME_TYPE doesn't exist in your dataset. This is likely due to a mismatch between the column names in your dataset and what the code expects. To resolve this, let's troubleshoot and modify the code step-by-step. We will first inspect your column names and then ensure that the code works properly based on the actual structure of your data.

Here’s the corrected and modified code:

First, check the column names of your dataset to see if CRIME_TYPE or a similarly named column exists.
Modify the column names in the code if necessary, ensuring that they match the actual names in your dataset.
Ensure that pivot_longer() correctly reshapes your data before summarizing or plotting.
Updated Code:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the cleaned and merged data
crime_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")

# Check the column names to ensure correct references
print(names(crime_data))

# Adjust column names based on the actual structure of your data
# For example, renaming 'YEAR' or 'CRIME_TYPE' if they differ
crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  rename(year = YEAR)  # Modify if the year column has a different name

# Proceed with pivot_longer() to reshape the data
# Adjust the column names based on the output of `names(crime_data)`
summary_stats <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(AREA_NAME, year),  # Keep relevant columns
    names_to = "crime_type",      # Name the reshaped column for crime types
    values_to = "crime_rate"      # Name the reshaped column for crime rates
  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print summary statistics to confirm output
print(summary_stats)

# Save summary statistics to Table 1 (CSV file)
write_csv(summary_stats, "tables/Table1_Summary_Statistics.csv")

# Now generate the trend graph
crime_trends <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(AREA_NAME, year),  # Same reshaping process as above
    names_to = "crime_type",      # Make sure the columns are correctly named
    values_to = "crime_rate"      # Name the reshaped value column
  ) %>%
  group_by(year, crime_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')  # Dropping unnecessary grouping

# Plot the trends
trend_plot <- ggplot(crime_trends, aes(x = year, y = avg_crime_rate, color = crime_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Crime Rate Trends from 2014 to 2023", x = "Year", y = "Crime Rate per 100,000") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the trend plot as an image
ggsave("figures/Figure1_Crime_Trends.png", plot = trend_plot, width = 10, height = 6)
Key Changes:
Check Column Names: The first step prints the column names to help you verify the correct names for year, crime_type, etc.
Rename Columns: Ensure that the rename() function adjusts the column names (YEAR, CRIME_TYPE, etc.) to match what is actually in your dataset.
Group by the Correct Column: The error was likely caused by grouping by CRIME_TYPE, which may not exist. The corrected code now assumes that crime_type is generated properly after reshaping with pivot_longer().
Check for Missing Values: The na.rm = TRUE ensures that missing values are ignored during calculations.
How to Fix It:
Run the code up to print(names(crime_data)) to inspect the exact column names in your dataset.
Modify the code accordingly, especially around renaming and reshaping steps, to match the structure of your data.
Once everything is verified, the code will generate summary statistics and a trend graph without the group_by() error.
If the column names in your dataset are different, you will need to adjust them in the code. Let me know if you encounter further issues!

Thanks for sharing the column names. Based on these, I'll update the code to reflect your actual dataset structure. Since your dataset includes columns for both the raw counts (e.g., ASSAULT) and their corresponding rates (e.g., ASSAULT_RATE), we'll focus on analyzing the rate columns.

Here's the revised code that should work for generating summary statistics and trend graphs based on your dataset:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the cleaned and merged data
crime_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")

# Check column names to ensure they match what we expect
print(names(crime_data))

# Reshape the data to long format, focusing on *_RATE columns for analysis
summary_stats <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),   # Select all columns that represent crime rates
    names_to = "crime_type",      # Create a column for the type of crime
    values_to = "crime_rate"      # Create a column for the crime rate values
  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print the summary statistics to verify output
print(summary_stats)

# Save summary statistics as Table 1
write_csv(summary_stats, "tables/Table1_Summary_Statistics.csv")

# Generate a trend graph for crime rates over the years
crime_trends <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),   # Select all crime rate columns for the trend analysis
    names_to = "crime_type",     # Name the reshaped column for crime type
    values_to = "crime_rate"     # Name the reshaped column for crime rates
  ) %>%
  group_by(year, crime_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')  # Calculate the average crime rate per year

# Plot the trends in crime rates over time
trend_plot <- ggplot(crime_trends, aes(x = year, y = avg_crime_rate, color = crime_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Crime Rate Trends from 2014 to 2023", x = "Year", y = "Crime Rate per 100,000") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the trend plot
ggsave("figures/Figure1_Crime_Trends.png", plot = trend_plot, width = 10, height = 6)
Key Changes Based on Your Data:
Using ends_with("_RATE"): Since your dataset contains both raw counts (e.g., ASSAULT) and rates (e.g., ASSAULT_RATE), we focus on columns that end with _RATE, as these are standardized crime rates per 100,000 population.
Pivoting the data: The pivot_longer() function reshapes all the crime rate columns (ASSAULT_RATE, BIKETHEFT_RATE, etc.) into a single crime_type column and corresponding crime_rate values.
Grouping by year and crime_type: The code groups the data by year and crime type to calculate the average crime rate for each year and crime type combination.
Expected Output:
Table 1 (Summary Statistics): A CSV file Table1_Summary_Statistics.csv will be created with the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime rate.
Figure 1 (Trend Graph): A line plot will be generated and saved as Figure1_Crime_Trends.png, showing the crime rate trends over time for each crime type.
Next Steps:
Run the code: Ensure that the paths (data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv, tables/Table1_Summary_Statistics.csv, and figures/Figure1_Crime_Trends.png) are correct for your environment.
Check for output: Verify that the summary statistics table and trend graph are correctly generated and saved in the specified locations.
This should now work without errors based on your dataset structure. Let me know if you run into any further issues!

Let's write a single, comprehensive R script that loads your data, prepares it for analysis, performs time series analysis for each crime type, and then plots the results with a linear trend line for each plot. This script will generate a multi-panel plot similar to the one you uploaded, where each panel shows the trend for a different crime type, including a linear model fit.

Here’s how you can set up your script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
crime_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")

# Convert 'year' to numeric if not already
crime_data$year <- as.numeric(crime_data$year)

# Reshape data to long format focusing only on RATE metrics
crime_long <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),   # Focus on columns that end with '_RATE'
    names_to = "crime_metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  separate(crime_metric, into = c("crime_type", "metric"), sep = "_RATE") %>%
  select(-metric)

# Aggregate data to get average crime rates per year across all NIA neighborhoods
annual_crime_rates <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(year, crime_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_rate = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Time Series Analysis and Plotting
plot_list <- annual_crime_rates %>%
  split(.$crime_type) %>%
  map(~{
    data <- .
    ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = avg_rate)) +
      geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Using black for the time series line
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkred", size = 1) +  # Linear model in dark red
      labs(
        title = paste("Trend in", unique(data$crime_type), "Rate"),
        x = "Year",
        y = "Average Crime Rate per 100,000"
      ) +
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  })

# Create a multi-panel plot
multi_plot <- plot_grid(plotlist = plot_list, labels = "auto", align = 'v', ncol = 3)
print(multi_plot)

# Save the combined plot
ggsave("figures/Crime_Trends.png", plot = multi_plot, width = 16, height = 12)
Key Components of the Script:
Libraries: Uses tidyverse for data manipulation, lubridate for any date manipulations if needed, and ggplot2 for plotting.
Data Loading and Transformation: Reads data, reshapes it to a long format focusing on rate metrics, and calculates average crime rates.
Plotting: For each type of crime, it generates a time series plot with a linear trend line. Uses map to apply plotting operations to each subset of the data and combines them into a multi-panel plot using plot_grid from the cowplot package.
Saving the Output: The final multi-panel plot is saved to a specified path.
What This Achieves:
Clarity: Each subplot clearly labels the crime type, ensuring viewers can easily discern which crime statistics they are viewing.
Consistency: All plots follow the same design template, making comparisons across crime types straightforward.
Accessibility: Outputs a single, comprehensive graphic that can be easily included in presentations or reports.
Before running the script, make sure you have the correct path to your dataset and that the structure of crime_data matches the expected format used in the script. Adjust any file paths as necessary to fit your directory structure. If the plot_grid function or cowplot is not recognized, you may need to install the cowplot package using install.packages("cowplot").

The error you encountered indicates that the function plot_grid wasn't recognized, which typically happens if the cowplot package is not loaded or not installed. To correct this, you should first ensure that cowplot is installed and then load it into your R session. Below is the corrected part of your script that includes the proper installation and loading of the cowplot package for the plot_grid function.

Here’s how to modify your script:

Install and load the cowplot package if it's not already installed.
Use the plot_grid function from the cowplot library to combine your plots.
r
Copy code
# Install cowplot if it's not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("cowplot", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("cowplot")
}

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)  # Ensure cowplot is loaded

# Load the data
crime_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")

# Convert 'year' to numeric if not already
crime_data$year <- as.numeric(crime_data$year)

# Reshape data to long format focusing only on RATE metrics

  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),   # Focus on columns that end with '_RATE'
    names_to = "crime_metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  separate(crime_metric, into = c("crime_type", "metric"), sep = "_RATE") %>%
  select(-metric)

# Aggregate data to get average crime rates per year across all NIA neighborhoods
annual_crime_rates <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(year, crime_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_rate = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Time Series Analysis and Plotting
plot_list <- annual_crime_rates %>%
  split(.$crime_type) %>%
  map(~{
    data <- .
    ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = avg_rate)) +
      geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Using black for the time series line
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkred", size = 1) +  # Linear model in dark red
      labs(
        title = paste("Trend in", unique(data$crime_type), "Rate"),
        x = "Year",
        y = "Average Crime Rate per 100,000"
      ) +
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  })

# Create a multi-panel plot using plot_grid from cowplot
multi_plot <- plot_grid(plotlist = plot_list, labels = "auto", align = 'v', ncol = 3)
print(multi_plot)

# Save the combined plot
ggsave("figures/Crime_Trends.png", plot = multi_plot, width = 16, height = 12)
This script should now work correctly with no errors about missing functions, assuming all the necessary packages are installed and correctly loaded. If you encounter further issues, make sure that the package installation was successful and that there are no typos in the package names or function calls.

do it withpout this package since I have mac...minimal code
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you prefer not to use additional packages like cowplot and want to keep the script minimal, you can utilize base ggplot2 functionalities along with facet_wrap to create a multi-panel plot directly. Here's how you can adjust your script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
crime_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/crime_statistics_nia_summary.csv")

# Ensure 'year' is numeric
crime_data$year <- as.numeric(crime_data$year)

# Reshape data to focus only on RATE metrics
crime_long <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),  # Select columns that end with '_RATE'
    names_to = "crime_type",
    values_to = "crime_rate"
  ) %>%
  mutate(crime_type = str_replace(crime_type, "_RATE", ""))  # Remove '_RATE' for cleaner axis labels

# Aggregate data to get average crime rates per year across all NIA neighborhoods
crime_rates <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(year, crime_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Plotting the trend for each crime type with a linear model
trend_plot <- ggplot(crime_rates, aes(x = year, y = avg_rate)) +
  geom_line() +  # Line graph for trends
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", formula = y ~ x) +  # Add linear trend line
  facet_wrap(~ crime_type, scales = "free_y") +  # Create separate plots for each crime type
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rate Trends from 2014 to 2023",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Crime Rate per 100,000"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Improve layout

# Save the plot
ggsave("figures/Crime_Trends.png", plot = trend_plot, width = 16, height = 12)
Explanation:
Libraries: This script only uses ggplot2 and dplyr from the tidyverse package for data manipulation and plotting.
Data Reshaping: The pivot_longer() function is used to transform crime data from wide to long format, focusing only on rate metrics.
Data Aggregation: Crime data is aggregated by year and crime type to calculate average rates.
Plotting: The facet_wrap() function creates a multi-panel plot for each crime type directly in ggplot2. Each plot will have its own y-axis scaled to the data of that specific crime type, and a linear model is added to each plot to show trends.
Saving the Plot: The plot is saved using ggsave(), specifying the dimensions of the output file.
This setup ensures you're using minimal additional packages and should run smoothly on a Mac or any other platform with R installed.

in my pdf im getting data like this
2 Data
##Data Source and Selection This study utilizes two datasets from the City of Toronto Open
Data Portal to analyze the impact of Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) on crime
rates from 2014 to 2023. The first dataset comprises annual crime counts for various offenses,
including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting
& Firearm Discharges. These crime rates are standardized per 100,000 population to allow for
fair comparisons across neighborhoods with different population sizes.
The second dataset identifies the NIAs designated under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods
Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), which aims to improve socio-economic conditions in selected areas.
The choice of these datasets is significant because the NIA designations were established in
2014, providing a clear starting point to assess the impact of this socio-economic intervention
on crime trends. The absence of pre-2014 data aligns with the focus on evaluating changes
following the NIA implementation.
I chose these datasets as they provide me with enough information to run time series analysis
and get enough visualiations to get idea of crime trends in these areas. Athough there are
some limitations which I will discuss later in the paper.

To ensure your PDF generated from a Quarto (or R Markdown) document is properly formatted, it's crucial to pay attention to how you structure and write your markdown. Here's how you can structure your Data section to ensure it formats correctly when converted to PDF:

Ensure Proper Markdown Syntax: Use proper headers and spacing to distinguish different sections and sub-sections.
Use Descriptive Text: Clearly define your section headers and include descriptive narrative to guide the reader through the data source, selection, and preparation steps.
Below is an example of how you might structure your Data section in a markdown document (such as Quarto or R Markdown) for optimal PDF formatting:

# Data

## Data Source and Selection

This study utilizes two datasets from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal to analyze the impact of Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) on crime rates from 2014 to 2023. The first dataset comprises annual crime counts for various offenses, including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. These crime rates are standardized per 100,000 population to allow for fair comparisons across neighborhoods with different population sizes.

The second dataset identifies the NIAs designated under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), which aims to improve socio-economic conditions in selected areas. The choice of these datasets is significant because the NIA designations were established in 2014, providing a clear starting point to assess the impact of this socio-economic intervention on crime trends. The absence of pre-2014 data aligns with the focus on evaluating changes following the NIA implementation.

## Data Preparation

To prepare the data for analysis, several steps were undertaken to ensure consistency and relevance. Firstly, the `AREA_NAME` fields in both datasets were standardized to lowercase to facilitate accurate merging based on neighborhood names.

- **Standardization**: All neighborhood names in the datasets were converted to lowercase to ensure consistent matching during data merging.
- **Reshaping**: The crime data was reshaped from wide format (where each type of crime is a separate column) to long format (where crime types are listed in one column and their counts in another), facilitating easier analysis.
- **Filtering**: Data was filtered to focus on years post-NIA implementation, i.e., from 2014 onwards, to directly assess the impacts of the initiative.

These preparation steps laid the foundation for a robust time series analysis aimed at uncovering trends and drawing meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness of NIAs in reducing crime rates.

Tips for Ensuring Proper Formatting:
Headers: Use #, ##, etc., to create section headers. This helps in automatically creating a structured layout in your PDF.
Lists: Use bullet points or numbered lists to break down information into readable chunks.
Code and Text: If you're embedding R code directly in your document, use triple backticks (```) to ensure it's recognized as code and not plain text.
Spacing: Make sure there are no unnecessary spaces or tabs that might confuse the markdown parser.
If you're using R Markdown or Quarto, here's how you can compile your document to PDF while ensuring high-quality formatting:

bash
Copy code
# For R Markdown
rmarkdown::render("your_document.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")

# For Quarto
quarto render your_document.qmd --to pdf
Make sure your text editor or the environment where you're writing markdown (like RStudio or any other code editor supporting markdown) is set up to show markdown syntax highlighting, as this can help you spot formatting errors before compiling to PDF.

The absence of pre-2014 data aligns with the focus on evaluating changes following the NIA implementation.

I chose these datasets as they provide me with enough information to run time series analysis and get enough visualiations to get idea of crime trends in these areas. Athough there are some limitations which I will discuss later in the paper.

## Data Preparation {#sec-data-preparation}
To prepare the data for analysis, several steps were undertaken to ensure consistency and relevance. Firstly, the AREA_NAME fields in both datasets were standardized to lowercase to facilitate accurate merging based on neighborhood names. The crime dataset was then filtered to include only records corresponding to the NIA-designated neighborhoods, ensuring the analysis specifically targets the areas of interest.

The crime data, originally in a wide format with separate columns for each crime type and year, was reshaped into a long format. This restructuring allows for easier manipulation and aggregation across different crime types and years. Subsequently, the data was aggregated by NIA, year, and crime type to compute total counts for each crime category annually.

## Summry Statistics {#sec-summary-statistics}
Summary statistics were calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of crime rates across the NIAs. Table 1 presents the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime type, offering insights into the typical crime levels and variability among the neighborhoods.

To visualize trends over time, Figure 1 illustrates the changes in crime rates from 2014 to 2023 for each crime type. This graph provides a clear depiction of how crime rates have evolved in the NIAs during the study period, highlighting any patterns or significant fluctuations.

The Quarto script you've provided looks generally well-structured and clear in its explanation of data source, selection, and preparation. However, there are a few minor issues and potential improvements that can be made to enhance readability and accuracy:

Typographical Errors:

"visualiations" should be corrected to "visualizations".
"Athough" should be corrected to "Although".
"Summry Statistics" should be corrected to "Summary Statistics".
Section ID Consistency:

Ensure that section IDs (used for linking within the document) are consistent and descriptive. For instance, {#sec-data-source} and {#sec-data-preparation} are good, but make sure they are used correctly if referenced elsewhere in the document.
Formatting and Styling:

It's a good practice to maintain consistent formatting for headings, lists, and paragraphs. Ensure that there's adequate spacing around headings and paragraphs for better readability.
Technical Details:

While you've described the transformation of the data well, make sure that the details are accurate according to the actual processes and code used in your analysis. For instance, when reshaping data and aggregating it, be specific about the functions or methods used if this is crucial for replicating the study.
Proofreading:

It’s essential to proofread the document for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings. This ensures the document maintains a professional and academic tone.
Linking Figures and Tables:

If you mention Table 1 and Figure 1, ensure that these are correctly generated and referenced in the document. You might also want to include a brief description or label for each within your markdown file to ensure they are understood clearly by readers.
Clear Objective Statement:

While you mention the datasets and their significance, consider adding a sentence summarizing the specific objective(s) of your analysis early in the Data Source and Selection section. This helps in setting a clear focus for the reader right from the start.
Here’s a revised snippet correcting some of the issues:

To enhance the appearance and integration of the summary statistics table within your Quarto document, consider enhancing the table format using the kable function from the knitr package along with kableExtra for additional styling options. These tools allow you to create more aesthetically pleasing and professional-looking tables suitable for academic and professional documents.

Here's how you can adjust your code to make the summary statistics table look prettier and integrate well with your paper:

markdown
Copy code
```{r tbl-summary-stats, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Load the necessary data
crime_data <- read_csv("path_to_your_data/crime_data.csv")

# Reshape the data to long format, focusing on *_RATE columns for analysis
summary_stats <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),   # Select all columns that represent crime rates
    names_to = "crime_type",     # Create a column for the type of crime
    values_to = "crime_rate"     # Create a column for the crime rate values
  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Standard Deviation` = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'  # Drop the grouping for nicer output
  )

# Use kable to generate a pretty table and kableExtra to style it
summary_stats %>%
  kable("latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")  # Header row styling
vbnet
Copy code

### Key Elements Added:
- **kable (knitr)**: Uses `kable` to create a basic table. The `"latex"` option enhances the table's appearance when compiling to PDF through LaTeX, which is typical in Quarto for PDF output.
- **kable_styling (kableExtra)**: Applies additional styling options such as `striped` (zebra-striping) and `scale_down` (to fit the table within the page margins if it's too wide).
- **column_spec & row_spec**: Further customize the appearance of specific columns and rows. Here, the first column (crime_type) is made bold with a right border, and the header row is also bolded with a gray background.

### Additional Notes:
- **Installation**: Ensure that `knitr` and `kableExtra` packages are installed with `install.packages("knitr")` and `install.packages("kableExtra")`.
- **Path to Data**: Replace `"path_to_your_data/crime_data.csv"` with the actual path to your dataset.
- **Output**: This setup is intended for PDF output. If you are targeting HTML or Word, some options like `"latex"` should be adjusted accordingly (e.g., use `"html"` for HTML output).

This approach should significantly enhance the visual quality of your summary statistics table, making it more suitable for inclusion in a professional document or academic paper.

why is this table giving 2 hwading table 1 and table 2
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue of seeing two headings labeled as "Table 1" and "Table 2" in your Quarto document likely arises from how Quarto automatically handles captions in tables generated with R code. This can happen if:

Automatic Numbering: Quarto automatically numbers tables based on their occurrence in the document when captions are added using R code.
Manual Captions: If you're using kable from the knitr package and have manually added a caption that includes "Table 1" within the caption text, it might cause a redundancy because Quarto might add another caption automatically.
How to Fix It
To avoid this issue, you can control the captioning directly within your R code without specifying "Table 1" manually, allowing Quarto to handle the numbering automatically. Here’s how you can modify your kable function to integrate well with Quarto’s automatic caption and numbering system:

r
Copy code
```{r tbl-summary-stats, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Assuming crime_data is already loaded and prepared
# Example data frame creation if not already provided
# crime_data <- data.frame(
#   Crime_Type = c("Assault", "Robbery"),
#   Rate = c(120, 80)
# )

# Reshape and summarize your data here if necessary
summary_stats <- data.frame(
  Crime_Type = c("Assault", "Robbery", "Theft"),
  Mean = c(100, 150, 75),
  Median = c(90, 145, 70),
  Standard_Deviation = c(10, 15, 5)
)

# Generate the table using kable
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
vbnet
Copy code

### Key Changes:
- **Caption**: The caption is provided directly in the `kable` function. Ensure you do not add "Table 1" or any numbering manually if you want Quarto to handle it automatically.
- **Results Format**: Ensure `results='asis'` is set in the chunk options to output raw HTML or LaTeX directly into the document.
- **No Manual Numbering**: Do not manually number the table in the text preceding or within the caption to avoid duplicate numbering.

### Additional Tip:
- If your document still shows two numbers, check for any other configurations or text in your document that might be adding extra table headings or captions. Sometimes, additional text or misconfigurations in document setup (like YAML headers or other markdown settings) can lead to such issues.

Ensure your Quarto document settings and package versions are up to date to avoid conflicts with rendering and numbering. If the problem persists, you might want to check the document’s compilation log for specific errors or warnings that can give more clues on the source of the issue.

The issue you are experiencing with the dual "Table 1" and "Table 2" titles likely stems from a conflict between Quarto's automatic table numbering and the manual captioning in the kable function. To resolve this and ensure you have only one table title, follow these steps:

1. Use Automatic Numbering Only
Remove any manual numbering or titles from your table caption in the kable function. Let Quarto handle the table numbering automatically to avoid duplication.

2. Update Your Code for Table Generation
Here is how you can modify your R code block in your Quarto document to ensure only one caption is generated for your table:

markdown
Copy code
```{r tbl-summary-stats, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Load the necessary data (this line is just an example, replace with your actual data loading code if needed)
# Assuming summary_stats is already prepared as per your previous message

# Generate the table using kable
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
vbnet
Copy code

### Key Points:
- **Caption**: The caption provided in `kable` should not include "Table 1" or any number. Write it as you would want it to appear directly.
- **Chunk Options**: Ensure `results='asis'` is included to output the table correctly in LaTeX or HTML (depending on your output format).
- **No Manual Title**: Do not add any manual titles before or after your R code block in the Quarto file. This ensures that Quarto's automatic caption feature handles the numbering.

### 3. **Check Quarto Configuration**
Ensure that your Quarto configuration doesn't include any settings that might be duplicating titles. For example, check your YAML front matter for settings related to table formatting or numbering that might be affecting your output.

### If the Problem Persists:
- **Check for Hidden Metadata**: Sometimes, metadata from previous runs (especially in an R environment) can cause unexpected behavior. Clear your environment and rerun your Quarto document.
- **Recompile the Document**: Sometimes, recompiling the document from scratch can resolve unexpected behavior caused by caching issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to produce a single, correctly numbered table title in your Quarto document.

The issue of "Table 1" appearing before "Table 2" is typically due to Quarto (or R Markdown, depending on your setup) automatically numbering the tables. This automatic numbering is combined with your explicitly defined table caption which includes the table number, leading to the redundant numbering.

Here’s how to solve this by preventing Quarto from automatically assigning a table number:

Solution 1: Remove Manual Numbering from Caption
Ensure that the table caption in your R code does not manually include "Table 2" or any numbering. Let Quarto handle all numbering to avoid any confusion or redundancy.

markdown
Copy code
```{r tbl-summary-stats, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Assuming crime_data is already loaded and prepared

# Generate the table using kable
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
vbnet
Copy code

### Solution 2: Adjusting the Quarto YAML for Table Numbering
If Quarto is still adding an undesired automatic number, you can adjust the YAML header of your Quarto document to either disable automatic table numbering or adjust how captions are processed.

However, in most standard Quarto setups, table and figure numbering is handled automatically and doesn't require specific YAML configurations to enable/disable it.

### Solution 3: Check for Hidden Markdown or Latex Commands
If you're using a custom template or have additional LaTeX commands in your document (either in the YAML front matter or hidden in some initialization chunk), ensure that there are no commands that might be interfering with table numbering.

### Example of Clean Code without Number in Caption:
Here is how your R code should ideally look, without specifying table numbers manually:

```r
```{r tbl-summary-stats, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Assuming summary_stats is already defined and prepared

# Generate the table using kable
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
sql
Copy code

Make sure there are no manual mentions of "Table 1", "Table 2", etc., in your markdown outside of this R code chunk. Quarto should handle the numbering automatically and sequentially based on the appearance of tables in the document. If the issue persists, double-check the entire document for any stray mentions or formatting commands related to table captions.

not have years mentioned in some of them as in image?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue with some years not appearing in the x-axis labels of your plots, as seen in the uploaded image, can occur due to several reasons in ggplot2:

Overlapping Labels: When there are too many labels or the labels are too close together, ggplot2 may automatically hide some to prevent overlapping and improve readability.
Scales and Breaks: The default setting for scales might not include every year, especially when using facet_wrap which can adjust scales for readability and space.
Plot Dimensions: The size of the plot can impact how labels are displayed. Smaller plot dimensions might lead to fewer labels being shown.
Solutions
To ensure that all years are displayed on the x-axis across all your subplots, you can adjust the breaks in the scale for the x-axis explicitly. Here’s how you can modify your ggplot2 code:

r
Copy code
```{r fig-crime-rate-plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Assuming crime_data is already loaded and prepared

# Reshape data to focus only on RATE metrics
crime_long <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),  # Select columns that end with '_RATE'
    names_to = "crime_type",
    values_to = "crime_rate"
  ) %>%
  mutate(crime_type = str_replace(crime_type, "_RATE", ""))  # Remove '_RATE' for cleaner axis labels

# Aggregate data to get average crime rates per year across all NIA neighborhoods
crime_rates <- crime_long %>%
  group_by(year, crime_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Plotting the trend for each crime type with a linear model
trend_plot <- ggplot(crime_rates, aes(x = year, y = avg_rate)) +
  geom_line() +  # Line graph for trends
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", formula = y ~ x) +  # Add linear trend line
  facet_wrap(~ crime_type, scales = "free_y") +  # Create separate plots for each crime type
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(crime_rates$year), max(crime_rates$year), by = 1)) + # Explicitly set breaks
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rate Trends from 2014 to 2023",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Crime Rate per 100,000"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Improve layout

trend_plot
sql
Copy code

### Key Modifications:
- **Explicitly Setting Year Breaks**: `scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(crime_rates$year), max(crime_rates$year), by = 1))` is added to ensure every year is marked. Adjust the `by = 1` as needed to include every year on the x-axis.
- **Label and Layout Adjustments**: Check the angle and justification of the x-axis text to ensure all years are legible and do not overlap.

These adjustments should help ensure that all years are displayed on the x-axis of each subplot in your visualizations, enhancing readability and ensuring consistency across the charts.

## Summary Statistics {#sec-summary-statistics}
Summary statistics were calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of crime rates across the NIAs. Table 1 (@tbl-summarystats) presents the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime type, offering insights into the typical crime levels and variability among the neighborhoods.

To visualize trends over time, Figure 1 illustrates the changes in crime rates from 2014 to 2023 for each crime type. This graph provides a clear depiction of how crime rates have evolved in the NIAs during the study period, highlighting any patterns or significant fluctuations.

It appears that you're encountering issues with cross-referencing tables in your Quarto document due to a typo and incorrect syntax in your R Markdown chunk options and markdown text. To ensure that table cross-referencing works properly, you'll need to adjust a few things:

Step 1: Correct Chunk Option Labels
You've misspelled label as laberl in your chunk options, which is crucial for referencing. Here’s how you should set it up:

markdown
Copy code
```{r tbl-summarystats, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Assuming summary_stats is already calculated and available
# Create the table using kable and add proper styling
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
vbnet
Copy code

### Step 2: Correct Cross-Reference in Text

To correctly reference the table in your text, make sure to use the correct syntax provided by Quarto or R Markdown. You should refer to it as `@ref(tbl-summarystats)` in your narrative text. Here’s how to modify your markdown:

```markdown
## Summary Statistics {#sec-summary-statistics}

Summary statistics were calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of crime rates across the NIAs. See Table \@ref(tbl-summarystats) for the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime type, offering insights into the typical crime levels and variability among the neighborhoods.

To visualize trends over time, Figure 1 illustrates the changes in crime rates from 2014 to 2023 for each crime type. This graph provides a clear depiction of how crime rates have evolved in the NIAs during the study period, highlighting any patterns or significant fluctuations.
Additional Notes:
Ensure Consistency: Make sure that the labels in your Quarto document are unique and correctly referenced in your narrative text.
Quarto Rendering: Depending on whether you're using Quarto to compile your document, ensure that you are using the correct functions and compilation settings specific to Quarto, as there might be slight differences in how cross-references are handled between R Markdown and Quarto.
Compile the Document
Make sure to compile your document using the correct commands in RStudio or command line, depending on your setup:

bash
Copy code
# For Quarto
quarto render your_document.qmd --to pdf

# For R Markdown (if applicable)
rmarkdown::render("your_document.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")
These adjustments should resolve the cross-referencing issue, allowing the PDF to correctly display the table number and link in your narrative text.

The issue of having "Table 1" and "Table 2" both appearing before your summary statistics table in the generated PDF can be addressed by adjusting how you manage table captions and references in your Quarto document.

The problem is likely occurring because:

Automatic Captioning: Quarto automatically numbers and captions tables based on the caption attribute you set in the kable() function.
Manual Reference Misuse: Misuse or misunderstanding of how table references are rendered in Quarto.
Solution:
Here's how you can correct your Quarto script to ensure only one caption appears with the correct numbering, and the reference works appropriately:

Ensure Correct Labeling: Use label instead of tbl-cap for defining captions in the Quarto code chunk options.
Correct Markdown Reference: Use the proper syntax to reference tables within your text.

Copy code

### Key Changes:
- **Label for Chunk**: Use `label` in your chunk options (`{r tbl-summarystats, echo=FALSE}`) to set up a proper label.
- **Reference**: Use `\@ref(tbl-summarystats)` to reference the table in your text correctly. Ensure that the label matches exactly what is defined in the chunk options.
- **Caption Handling**: Ensure the `caption` attribute in the `kable()` function does not manually include "Table 1" or any other number, as Quarto will handle this automatically.

By following these steps, you should have a single, correctly numbered table with a proper reference in your Quarto-generated PDF document.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Selection {#sec-data-source}
This study utilizes two datasets from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal to analyze the impact of Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) on crime rates from 2014 to 2023. The first dataset includes annual crime counts for various offenses, including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. These crime rates are standardized per 100,000 population to allow for fair comparisons across neighborhoods with different population sizes.

The second dataset identifies the NIAs designated under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), which aims to improve socio-economic conditions in selected areas. The choice of these datasets is significant because the NIA designations were established in 2014, providing a clear starting point to assess the impact of this socio-economic intervention on crime trends. The absence of pre-2014 data aligns with the focus on evaluating changes following the NIA implementation.

I chose these datasets as they provide me with enough information to run time series analysis and get enough visualizations to understand crime trends in these areas. Although there are some limitations, which I will discuss later in the paper.

## Data Preparation {#sec-data-preparation}
To prepare the data for analysis, several steps were undertaken to ensure consistency and relevance. Firstly, the AREA_NAME fields in both datasets were standardized to lowercase to facilitate accurate merging based on neighborhood names. The crime dataset was then filtered to include only records corresponding to the NIA-designated neighborhoods, ensuring the analysis specifically targets the areas of interest.

The crime data, originally in a wide format with separate columns for each crime type and year, was reshaped into a long format. This restructuring allows for easier manipulation and aggregation across different crime types and years. Subsequently, the data was aggregated by NIA, year, and crime type to compute total counts for each crime category annually.

## Summary Statistics {#sec-summary-statistics}
Summary statistics were calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of crime rates across the NIAs. (@tbl-summarystats) presents the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime type, offering insights into the typical crime levels and variability among the neighborhoods.

The issue with the table being displayed twice and being moved to the top of the page in your Quarto-generated PDF document may stem from how LaTeX processes floating environments (like tables) and how Quarto handles automatic table numbering. Here's how you can address this:

Preventing Floating and Ensuring Correct Table Placement
In LaTeX, tables are typically treated as floating objects, which means they can be moved around the page to optimize space and formatting. To make the table stay where it is declared and avoid it appearing twice, you can modify how the table is rendered.

Non-floating Table: Use the position argument in kable_styling() to specify where the table should appear. The position = "h" option can be used to ensure it does not float.
Ensure Correct Labeling and Referencing: Ensure that the label in your R chunk matches exactly with your cross-referencing in the text and is properly formatted. Check for duplicates or repeated calls that might be causing the issue.
Here’s a refined version of your table code:

## Summary Statistics {#sec-summary-statistics}

Summary statistics were calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of crime rates across the NIAs. See Table 1 below for the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime type, offering insights into the typical crime levels and variability among the neighborhoods.

To visualize trends over time, Figure 1 illustrates the changes in crime rates from 2014 to 2023 for each crime type. This graph provides a clear depiction of how crime rates have evolved in the NIAs during the study period, highlighting any patterns or significant fluctuations.

```{r tbl-summarystats, echo=FALSE}

# Reshape the data to long format, focusing on *_RATE columns for analysis
summary_stats <- crime_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_RATE"),   # Select all columns that represent crime rates
    names_to = "crime_type",     # Create a column for the type of crime
    values_to = "crime_rate"     # Create a column for the crime rate values
  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Standard Deviation` = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'  # Drop the grouping for nicer output
  )

# Generate a table that doesn't float

      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"), position = "h") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
sql
Copy code

### Notes:
- **Position 'h'**: This will attempt to place the table exactly where it is in the source text.
- **Labeling in Cross-referencing**: Replace any manual "Table 1" text in your narrative with cross-references that let Quarto handle numbering, e.g., `@ref(tbl-summarystats)`.

This setup should prevent the table from floating to the top and avoid any numbering issues. If the table still floats or numbers incorrectly, ensure that there are no additional LaTeX packages or Quarto settings interfering with the default table handling.

The error you're encountering is due to an incorrect argument value for the position parameter in kable_styling(). Unfortunately, the kableExtra package does not directly support a non-floating option like "h" which is typical in LaTeX environments. The position option in kable_styling() controls the horizontal alignment rather than whether the table floats.

To control the floating behavior of your table in a Quarto or R Markdown document, you need to use LaTeX commands directly or adjust your setup to prevent automatic floating without the position = "h" parameter, which is not supported by kableExtra.

Solution: Using LaTeX Commands for Non-floating Tables
If you are rendering to PDF and need to ensure the table does not float, you can wrap your table in a LaTeX environment that prevents floating. Here's how you can manually insert LaTeX commands to control this:

Use Raw LaTeX Tags: Directly before and after your table output, you can manually insert LaTeX commands to begin and end a non-floating environment.
Here's how you can modify your R chunk to include these tags:

  )

# Print the LaTeX commands to begin the non-floating table environment

  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")

# End the non-floating table environment
cat("\\endgroup")
r
Copy code

### Explanation:
- **`\\begingroup\\let\\centering\\relax`**: This LaTeX command sequence is used to start a group that neutralizes the effect of `\centering`, which is commonly applied to tables, effectively preventing it from floating.
- **`\\endgroup`**: This ends the group and any settings applied within it.

This approach manually injects LaTeX to control the floating behavior of the table, overcoming limitations in `kableExtra` for directly controlling float properties. Ensure your document compiles with LaTeX without errors, as direct LaTeX manipulation requires a correct setup in your document environment.

The issue of "Table 1" and "Table 2" both appearing before your summary statistics table in the generated PDF likely stems from how the table caption is being handled in combination with Quarto's automatic handling of table environments and captions.

Understanding the Problem
Quarto and the underlying LaTeX engine are interpreting your table captions in a way that results in the automatic addition of a table number and caption. This can occur if Quarto is set to automatically handle figures and tables numbering but finds conflicting cues from the markup or style specifications.

Solution: Ensuring Single, Correctly Formatted Table Captions
Ensure Correct Use of Labels and Captions: Ensure that you are not duplicating captions within your kable() function and the Quarto markdown text. Quarto should handle the captioning automatically if specified correctly within the kable() or kableExtra styling functions.

Direct LaTeX Commands: Since adjusting the kable_styling() did not resolve the issue, consider simplifying the command or explicitly controlling LaTeX's float behavior without repeating the caption.

Modify R Code Chunk: Adjust the R code chunk to ensure that it only defines the table once, and use LaTeX directly if necessary to control the table's placement or numbering explicitly.

Revised R Code Chunk
Here’s a revised version of your R chunk ensuring that the caption is specified once and correctly:

Copy code
```{r tbl-summarystats, echo=FALSE}

# Reshape the data to long format for analysis

    names_to = "crime_type", 
    values_to = "crime_rate"
  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Standard Deviation` = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'  # Ensures that the grouping is dropped after summarization
  )

# Use kable to create the table
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%

# Data {#sec-data}

## Data Source and Selection {#sec-data-source}
This study utilizes two datasets from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal to analyze the impact of Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) on crime rates from 2014 to 2023. The first dataset includes annual crime counts for various offenses, including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. These crime rates are standardized per 100,000 population to allow for fair comparisons across neighborhoods with different population sizes.

The second dataset identifies the NIAs designated under the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy 2020 (TSNS2020), which aims to improve socio-economic conditions in selected areas. The choice of these datasets is significant because the NIA designations were established in 2014, providing a clear starting point to assess the impact of this socio-economic intervention on crime trends. The absence of pre-2014 data aligns with the focus on evaluating changes following the NIA implementation.

I chose these datasets as they provide me with enough information to run time series analysis and get enough visualizations to understand crime trends in these areas. Although there are some limitations, which I will discuss later in the paper.

## Data Preparation {#sec-data-preparation}
To prepare the data for analysis, several steps were undertaken to ensure consistency and relevance. Firstly, the AREA_NAME fields in both datasets were standardized to lowercase to facilitate accurate merging based on neighborhood names. The crime dataset was then filtered to include only records corresponding to the NIA-designated neighborhoods, ensuring the analysis specifically targets the areas of interest.

The crime data, originally in a wide format with separate columns for each crime type and year, was reshaped into a long format. This restructuring allows for easier manipulation and aggregation across different crime types and years. Subsequently, the data was aggregated by NIA, year, and crime type to compute total counts for each crime category annually.

## Summary Statistics {#sec-summary-statistics}
Summary statistics were calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of crime rates across the NIAs. @tbl-summarystats presents the mean, median, and standard deviation for each crime type, offering insights into the typical crime levels and variability among the neighborhoods.

To visualize trends over time, Figure 1 illustrates the changes in crime rates from 2014 to 2023 for each crime type. This graph provides a clear depiction of how crime rates have evolved in the NIAs during the study period, highlighting any patterns or significant fluctuations.

  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Standard Deviation` = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'  # Ensures that the grouping is dropped after summarization
  )

# Use kable to create the table

It seems like the issue with "Table 1" and "Table 2" appearing before your summary statistics table in the generated PDF is persisting due to an interaction between Quarto (or R Markdown) and LaTeX rendering specifics that might not be straightforwardly controlled by the kable() function from the knitr package or kableExtra.

Diagnosing the Issue
Automatic Numbering: Quarto and LaTeX automatically handle numbering for tables when they are rendered. If a caption is set in both the R chunk with kable() and within the Quarto text narrative, it might cause duplication or misnumbering.
Caption Handling: If the Quarto engine interprets any text or markdown formatting as a new table or figure, it may automatically assign it a number.
Solution: Streamline Caption Handling
To prevent Quarto from double-numbering or misplacing captions, ensure that you are consistent with where and how you assign captions. Here are some steps to resolve it:

Set Captions Only in kable(): Ensure that you only set the table caption in the kable() function call and not elsewhere in your text or markdown. Remove any manual "Table 1" text from your narrative and rely on the caption provided by kable().

Check Your Chunk Options: Ensure that the chunk label is correctly spelled and used uniformly. For instance, label: tbl-summarystats should match in the cross-references.

Revised Code Snippet: Here's how you should adjust the chunk to ensure the table is only numbered once and correctly referenced:

    values_to = "crime_rate"
  ) %>%
  group_by(crime_type) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Standard Deviation` = sd(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Render the table with kable
kable(summary_stats, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE,

  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#D3D3D3")
Check Document Compilation
After making these changes, compile your document again and check the output. Ensure there's no manual reference to "Table 1" or "Table 2" in your narrative sections unless specifically discussing those figures.
Use @ref(tbl-summarystats) in your text to reference the table correctly without manually typing "Table 1".
This should streamline the numbering and avoid any duplication in labels or captions, making your document cleaner and more consistent with academic and professional formatting standards.

Based on the data and trends observed from the provided graph and time series analysis, here is a quick overview for the Results section of your paper:

Results Overview
Key Findings
The analysis of crime rates from 2014 to 2023 in Toronto's Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) reveals mixed results across various crime categories:

Assault rates have shown a consistent increase over the study period, as indicated by the positive slope in the time series analysis. The trend line in the graph suggests a notable rise, particularly in recent years.
Robbery and Break and Enter rates have generally declined, with the linear models indicating significant negative slopes and substantial

Statistical Analysis Highlight and Justification
For our study, we employed linear regression models to identify trends in crime rates across different types. This method was chosen because it allows us to observe changes over time and quantitatively assess whether crime rates are increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable. Linear regression is beneficial for this analysis as it provides a straightforward interpretation of data trends through the slope and intercept values, making it easier for both technical and non-technical audiences to understand the results. The findings, such as the significant decrease in robbery rates and the steady increase in theft from motor vehicles, help us pinpoint which crime interventions are effective and which areas require further attention or different strategies.

Statistical Analysis Justification
We applied linear regression models to analyze crime trends, as these models efficiently estimate changes in crime rates over time. This approach directly links the slope of each trend line to the annual change in crime rates, allowing us to determine whether specific crimes are increasing or decreasing across the designated neighborhoods. By evaluating the statistical significance and the strength of the trends (p-values and R-squared values), we identified which types of crimes were most affected by the interventions, supporting targeted policy adjustments.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}
The examination of a publicly available dataset on renewable energy installations from 2010 to 2019 offers valuable insights into Toronto's renewable energy landscape. The observed upward trajectory in the number of installations, peaking notably in 2017 and 2018, indicates a concerted effort to expand and diversify the city's renewable energy infrastructure. Although the kilowatt size of installations does not exhibit a clear trend, the data reveals a strategic shift towards incorporating a variety of installation types, encompassing both smaller and larger systems.

The subsequent exploration of the relationship between installation size, type, and their distribution over time is crucial to understanding the city's commitment. The regression analysis on installation size over the years, although inconclusive due to varying variances, reinforces how installation size and type interact, and the role that different financing models may play. The concentration of smaller installations in certain years, such as 2017, further emphasizes the importance of considering installation types when interpreting size trends.

The geographical distribution map illustrates how even in earlier years, installations were spread across the city, with subsequent strategic efforts to fill gaps and extend installations into the periphery (e.g. North York and Scarborough) in recent years. This trend signifies a strategic and deliberate expansion beyond the downtown core, reflecting an equitable approach to renewable energy infrastructure.

However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this analysis. The dataset primarily focuses on city divisions, excluding data from other city agencies or public-private partnerships involved in renewable energy initiatives. This limitation may impact the comprehensiveness of the dataset and potentially overlook significant installations managed by other entities.

In conclusion, the city government's commitment towards sustainable energy practices is evident in the increasing number and strategic distribution of renewable energy installations. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of Toronto's commitment to renewable energy, paving the way for informed discussions on the city's progress and future endeavors in combating climate change.

Detailed Analysis of Crime Trends {#sec-detailed-analysis}
The linear regression models applied to the crime data from Toronto's Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) provide a systematic evaluation of crime trends over a nine-year period, from 2014 to 2023. These models helped identify both general trends and specific fluctuations in crime rates, enabling a detailed understanding of the impacts of socio-economic policies and other external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key Observations from the Analysis
Decrease in Property Crimes: There was a notable decrease in property crimes such as robbery, break and enter, bike theft, and assaults starting in 2020. These trends, as depicted in @fig-crime_rate_plot, potentially correlate with the lockdowns and reduced public activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this study did not specifically research the pandemic's impact, the temporal correlation suggests that external, large-scale social changes significantly affect crime dynamics.

Stability in Violent Crimes: Violent crimes such as homicide and shootings displayed less consistency in their trends, with rates fluctuating without a clear downward or upward trajectory. These findings indicate that while some crime rates can be influenced by broad socio-economic initiatives, others, particularly violent crimes, may be driven by factors not encapsulated within the scope of NIA interventions.

Trends in Theft-Related Crimes: The increase in theft from motor vehicles over the study period, contrasting with the general decrease in other property crimes post-2020, suggests that certain types of crimes may be more resilient to socio-economic interventions or influenced by different factors.

Additional Observations
Impact of Socio-Economic Changes: While NIAs are designed to bolster socio-economic conditions, the varied impact on different types of crimes underscores the complexity of crime as a social phenomenon. The observed reductions in some crime rates may reflect successful aspects of these initiatives, whereas the persistence or increase in others suggests areas where additional measures might be needed.

Potential for Further Research: The variations in crime trends, especially the stability in violent crimes and the peculiar trends in homicides and shootings, point to underlying factors that could be unique to those crimes or affected by broader socio-economic conditions not directly targeted by NIA policies.

Limitations of the Current Analysis
The analysis is constrained by the absence of data prior to the implementation of NIAs in 2014, which limits the ability to assess long-term trends and pre-existing conditions in crime rates. Additionally, the influence of unexplored external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the need for further research to disentangle these impacts from those driven by NIA policies.

Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}
This detailed examination of crime rates within Toronto's NIAs using linear regression models sheds light on the nuanced impacts of socio-economic improvements on various types of crimes. The results not only reinforce the significance of targeted socio-economic interventions in reducing certain types of crimes but also highlight the resilience of others to such interventions. These insights are vital for policymakers to refine and focus efforts on areas where they can be most effective, ensuring a safer and more equitable urban environment.

## Overview
The analysis of crime rates from 2014 to 2023 in Toronto's Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) presents a varied and mixed of crime dynamics, reflecting the complex interplay of socio-economic interventions and urban policy measures. Also some very big factors such as Covid-19 may have also played very important role in some crimes increasing or decreasing but it was out of scope for this paper.

## Key Observations
This section presents concise bullet points summarizing the notable trends and significant findings from the crime data analysis in NIA neighbourhoods just based on data we have:

- **Increase in Assault and Theft-Related Crimes:** 
  - There is a noticeable upward trend in assault and theft-related crimes such as Theft from Motor Vehicles and Theft Over. This suggests that despite interventions, these areas still face challenges and may require enhanced strategies or targeted interventions.
  
- **Decrease in Robbery and Break and Enter:**
  - The data shows a decline in the rates of robbery and break and enter incidents, indicating some effectiveness in the measures implemented to curb these types of crimes.
  
- **Stability in Severe Crimes:**
  - Rates of severe crimes such as homicide and shootings have remained relatively stable. This stability calls for a sustained or possibly different approach to effectively address these serious offenses.

## Model justification

We applied linear regression models to analyze crime trends, as these models efficiently estimate changes in crime rates over time. This approach directly links the slope of each trend line to the annual change in crime rates, allowing us to determine whether specific crimes are increasing or decreasing across the designated neighborhoods. By evaluating the statistical significance and the strength of the trends (p-values and R-squared values), we identified which types of crimes were most affected by the interventions, supporting targeted policy adjustments.

Discussion {#sec-discussion}
The analysis of crime trends in Toronto's Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) over the period from 2014 to 2023 has yielded mixed results, illustrating the intricate nature of how socio-economic policies and broader societal changes impact urban crime rates. The utilization of linear regression models has provided a structured approach to decipher these impacts, revealing both successes and areas needing further attention within the NIA framework.

Detailed Analysis of Crime Trends
The regression analysis highlights several key trends in crime dynamics:

Decrease in Property Crimes: The marked decline in property crimes such as robbery and break and enter from 2020 onwards coincides with the global onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically altered public behaviors and potentially limited opportunities for such crimes. This correlation suggests that external factors, including public health interventions that limit social interaction, can significantly influence crime rates.

Persistent Violent Crimes: Despite socio-economic efforts under the TSNS2020, severe crimes like homicide and shootings have not shown significant reductions. This persistence might be indicative of deeper, systemic issues that are not as easily mitigated through area-based interventions alone and may require more focused, perhaps even individualized, approaches to prevention and law enforcement.

Increase in Theft-Related Crimes: Conversely, crimes such as theft from motor vehicles have seen an upward trend, suggesting that certain types of property crimes are evolving or that new methods of perpetration are being developed that are not adequately addressed by current preventive measures.

Additional Observations
Further observations underscore the complex relationship between socio-economic initiatives and crime:

Covid-19 Impacts: The fluctuations in certain crime rates during the pandemic highlight the potential impact of external, non-policy related factors on crime trends. These observations provide an inadvertent study into how societal changes influence urban crime and serve as a reminder of the need to adapt crime prevention strategies in response to wide-scale social changes.

Variability in Crime Trends: The varying impact of NIA initiatives on different types of crimes underscores the complexity of addressing urban crime through socio-economic measures alone. While some interventions appear successful in reducing property crimes, violent crimes remain stubbornly high, suggesting that other factors such as community relations, policing strategies, and social services play critical roles.

Limitations and Further Research
This analysis is limited by the absence of pre-2014 data, which restricts the ability to comprehensively assess the full impact of NIA policies introduced in 2014. Moreover, the external factor of the COVID-19 pandemic presents both a limitation and a unique point of analysis, suggesting the need for further research into how such global events can be integrated into urban crime prevention strategies.

Conclusions
The findings from this study contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of Toronto's NIAs in reducing certain crimes, while also highlighting the resilience of violent crimes to these interventions. For policymakers, these insights are crucial in refining and directing future efforts to not only continue reducing property crimes but also to more effectively tackle violent crimes within these communities. This study also underscores the importance of flexible, responsive policy frameworks that can adapt to unexpected societal changes, such as those brought about by global pandemics.

# Detailed Analysis of Crime Trends {#sec-detailed-analysis}

The regression analysis provides a clear picture of the different trajectories of crime categories in Toronto's Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIAs) over the observed period:

- **Decrease in Property Crimes:** Notably, there was a significant decline in property crimes such as robbery and break and enter incidents during and after the year 2020. The timing correlates with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought unprecedented changes to public behavior and social interactions, likely limiting opportunities for these types of crimes. This decrease illustrates the substantial impact that external societal changes can have on crime patterns.

- **Persistent Violent Crimes:** In contrast, more severe crimes such as homicide and shootings did not show a significant decrease over the years. This stability suggests that the interventions under the TSNS2020 may not have been as effective for these types of crimes. The persistence of these offenses highlights the need for more targeted strategies that address the root causes and contexts that contribute to violent crime.

- **Increase in Theft-Related Crimes:** On the other hand, an increase in theft-related offenses, particularly theft from motor vehicles, suggests that as some types of crime decrease, others find new avenues or methods. This trend points to the adaptive nature of criminal behavior and the ongoing challenge for urban policy and law enforcement to keep pace with evolving crime tactics.

## Additional Observations {#sec-additional-observations}

While the main focus of this analysis was on the crime trends directly influenced by NIA interventions, several additional factors were noted that could influence future policy decisions:

- **Covid-19 Impacts:** The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime rates provides an unintended case study into how large-scale public health crises can affect urban crime. The lockdowns and the subsequent decrease in certain crime rates during this period provide a unique dataset for understanding how changes in population movement and social patterns can influence criminal activity.

- **Cyclical Nature of Certain Crimes:** The analysis also observed that some crimes, such as shootings and homicides, exhibit a cyclical pattern that does not correlate straightforwardly with socio-economic interventions. This observation suggests that other variables, possibly cultural, relational, or linked to deeper societal issues, play significant roles in these crime rates.

The findings from this detailed analysis provide a nuanced view of the impacts of Toronto's NIAs, offering essential insights for policymakers to consider in future urban planning and crime prevention strategies.
